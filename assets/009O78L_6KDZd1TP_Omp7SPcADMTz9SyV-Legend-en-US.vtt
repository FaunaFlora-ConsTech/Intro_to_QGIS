00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:05.841
In this video we're looking at
how to add a legend onto our

b1c6c0ac-0fb0-4c91-898a-2d741f431799-1
00:00:05.841 --> 00:00:06.760
print layout.

d40cbcd2-d81e-453b-b56b-1738e563696e-0
00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:11.560
So to do that we need to go up
into the Add Item tab along the

d40cbcd2-d81e-453b-b56b-1738e563696e-1
00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:15.364
menu bar, click on that, and
click on where it says Add

d40cbcd2-d81e-453b-b56b-1738e563696e-2
00:00:15.364 --> 00:00:15.840
Legend.

71f6edfc-4542-4896-a626-9eaee1034865-0
00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:22.344
This is going to give our mouse
the tool to draw it onto our

71f6edfc-4542-4896-a626-9eaee1034865-1
00:00:22.344 --> 00:00:26.393
layout, so don't worry that we
don't have enough space on our

71f6edfc-4542-4896-a626-9eaee1034865-2
00:00:26.393 --> 00:00:26.720
page.

fcee6690-44b8-45c5-8f12-2c4290a4a28a-0
00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.313
We can just draw it to overlap
the page and then we'll resize

fcee6690-44b8-45c5-8f12-2c4290a4a28a-1
00:00:31.313 --> 00:00:32.280
the page later.

920fee75-6d30-4c8e-a552-2d35f36e9b60-0
00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:33.880
So let's draw it on.

429f2e94-7497-415f-8bc8-75c04f27cfb8-0
00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:38.300
And now we can see that QGIS has
automatically populated our

429f2e94-7497-415f-8bc8-75c04f27cfb8-1
00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.760
legend with the elements that
are within our map.

347bdb3e-ac2a-41b8-87bf-8d18a58484fd-0
00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.301
So we can see we've got our
biomonitoring points, the roads,

347bdb3e-ac2a-41b8-87bf-8d18a58484fd-1
00:00:47.301 --> 00:00:51.192
the Ziama protected area, the
land cover types and we also

347bdb3e-ac2a-41b8-87bf-8d18a58484fd-2
00:00:51.192 --> 00:00:54.950
have elevation and the Esri
standard base map on here as

347bdb3e-ac2a-41b8-87bf-8d18a58484fd-3
00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:55.280
well.

99208953-2b5f-4f10-825a-02123e526358-0
00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:01.282
If you wanted to change your
legend further, what you need to

99208953-2b5f-4f10-825a-02123e526358-1
00:01:01.282 --> 00:01:05.662
do is click on it either on the
layout page or within the items

99208953-2b5f-4f10-825a-02123e526358-2
00:01:05.662 --> 00:01:09.494
list and then go to item
properties and now here we can

99208953-2b5f-4f10-825a-02123e526358-3
00:01:09.494 --> 00:01:13.258
have all the buttons for
changing our legend to get it

99208953-2b5f-4f10-825a-02123e526358-4
00:01:13.258 --> 00:01:14.080
how we want.

cf54ac42-8ff2-4b7d-8392-1bf3fe5b4835-0
00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:19.021
So in the main properties
section at the top we can change

cf54ac42-8ff2-4b7d-8392-1bf3fe5b4835-1
00:01:19.021 --> 00:01:23.484
the title of our legend, so
let's call it Biomonitoring

cf54ac42-8ff2-4b7d-8392-1bf3fe5b4835-2
00:01:23.484 --> 00:01:24.520
(Ziama; 2019)

86f5c5ae-0d32-43e0-9c5d-a244ea954124-0
00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.247
And now we can see this has
changed the legend within our

86f5c5ae-0d32-43e0-9c5d-a244ea954124-1
00:01:30.247 --> 00:01:31.280
print layout page.

bc6b34ad-0581-4d5c-8862-e04615857e78-0
00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.347
Now let's take a look at how to
get rid of the items within our

bc6b34ad-0581-4d5c-8862-e04615857e78-1
00:01:35.347 --> 00:01:37.000
legend that we don't need.

d081155f-ece9-4db3-a675-df50283c40b6-0
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.285
So the elevation and the ESRI
standard basemap, they're not in

d081155f-ece9-4db3-a675-df50283c40b6-1
00:01:40.285 --> 00:01:42.840
our map and so we don't need
them in our legend.

7f8884e8-224c-41e9-bde4-8050fc33d594-0
00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.223
So if we scroll down in item
properties to where it says

7f8884e8-224c-41e9-bde4-8050fc33d594-1
00:01:46.223 --> 00:01:49.566
Legend items, we can untick this
box that says Auto update and

7f8884e8-224c-41e9-bde4-8050fc33d594-2
00:01:49.566 --> 00:01:52.696
now we're going to be able to
change the items to keep the

7f8884e8-224c-41e9-bde4-8050fc33d594-3
00:01:52.696 --> 00:01:55.720
ones we want and get rid of the
ones that we don't need.

c3881993-0ac2-4877-9e47-5bd3a2ba0320-0
00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:58.862
So we're going to keep the
biomonitoring points, the roads

c3881993-0ac2-4877-9e47-5bd3a2ba0320-1
00:01:58.862 --> 00:02:01.564
Ziama protected area and the
land cover because we can see

c3881993-0ac2-4877-9e47-5bd3a2ba0320-2
00:02:01.564 --> 00:02:02.480
them all in our map.

035c5376-01ff-44ed-b2c1-462fee9d1eb2-0
00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.840
But let's get rid of elevation
and the basemap.

22bd6146-5fdc-4a66-89e5-4355e6221b00-0
00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.629
So to do that just click on the
thing you want to get rid of

22bd6146-5fdc-4a66-89e5-4355e6221b00-1
00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:14.500
within the legend items box and
now we can click the red minus

22bd6146-5fdc-4a66-89e5-4355e6221b00-2
00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.495
symbol at the bottom here and so
we can see if we take a look in

22bd6146-5fdc-4a66-89e5-4355e6221b00-3
00:02:18.495 --> 00:02:21.200
our legend that's got rid of the
elevation.

b1281da9-aa17-42d0-83e3-ea0d6622c1ab-0
00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.905
So let's do the same for the
ESRI standard base map, just

b1281da9-aa17-42d0-83e3-ea0d6622c1ab-1
00:02:26.905 --> 00:02:31.277
click on it, click the the red
minus button and now we just

b1281da9-aa17-42d0-83e3-ea0d6622c1ab-2
00:02:31.277 --> 00:02:34.920
have the elements that we want
within our legend.

82171304-e0a5-4f67-8390-67931ea1f5df-0
00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:40.854
So I'm just going to move this
just to get it centred and now

82171304-e0a5-4f67-8390-67931ea1f5df-1
00:02:40.854 --> 00:02:45.861
looking in our item properties
we can see we've got lots of

82171304-e0a5-4f67-8390-67931ea1f5df-2
00:02:45.861 --> 00:02:50.033
different tabs, lots of
different options for the

82171304-e0a5-4f67-8390-67931ea1f5df-3
00:02:50.033 --> 00:02:52.120
properties of our legend.

576ce8ca-bc54-4b18-9ff7-80cecf9caef7-0
00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:55.400
We're just going to take a look
at the frame tab here.

3a101685-c882-4f0c-b3b2-73c36ad7d615-0
00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:01.543
So let's toggle on frames so
that we can add an outline to

3a101685-c882-4f0c-b3b2-73c36ad7d615-1
00:03:01.543 --> 00:03:07.440
our box and it's automatically
put our box outline as black.

174b1380-6b65-41c0-a140-c8f15ccf78a0-0
00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:11.922
So that's fine, we can keep it
how it is, but you can change

174b1380-6b65-41c0-a140-c8f15ccf78a0-1
00:03:11.922 --> 00:03:16.331
the colour by clicking on the
colour box here and now we've

174b1380-6b65-41c0-a140-c8f15ccf78a0-2
00:03:16.331 --> 00:03:20.667
added a black outline to our
legend so it's nice and clear

174b1380-6b65-41c0-a140-c8f15ccf78a0-3
00:03:20.667 --> 00:03:25.443
and so that's great, we've added
our legend and we've got it how

174b1380-6b65-41c0-a140-c8f15ccf78a0-4
00:03:25.443 --> 00:03:26.840
we want it to look.

7d81e29c-c446-4510-a5be-e1719f3c833e-0
00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:30.649
The last thing we need to do is
just resize our page to fit the

7d81e29c-c446-4510-a5be-e1719f3c833e-1
00:03:30.649 --> 00:03:31.040
legend.

1acef81f-c344-41f7-a985-f82478be498c-0
00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:35.381
So to do that, we're going to go
in layout here on the right hand

1acef81f-c344-41f7-a985-f82478be498c-1
00:03:35.381 --> 00:03:39.393
side and we'll scroll down to
where it says resize layout to

1acef81f-c344-41f7-a985-f82478be498c-2
00:03:39.393 --> 00:03:39.919
content.

633cde8f-8b34-44ba-9389-392bc5249be5-0
00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:43.544
And then we can just click this
button here where it says resize

633cde8f-8b34-44ba-9389-392bc5249be5-1
00:03:43.544 --> 00:03:43.840
layout.

43e4870f-794a-4224-932b-d576f45bf2fa-0
00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:47.851
And that's going to change our
page so that our legend fits

43e4870f-794a-4224-932b-d576f45bf2fa-1
00:03:47.851 --> 00:03:48.480
inside it.

87236c2e-cc54-4ea6-a6fe-ea55a06758f9-0
00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:53.760
And that's how to add a legend
onto your print layout in QGIS.
