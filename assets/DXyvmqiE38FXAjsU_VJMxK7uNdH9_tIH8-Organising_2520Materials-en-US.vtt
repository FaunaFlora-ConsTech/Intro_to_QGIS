00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.392
When setting up a project in
QGIS, the first thing we want to

17bf4bf7-6c3d-4997-bb92-97424f179a3a-1
00:00:06.392 --> 00:00:10.604
do is create a folder to store
our materials related to the

17bf4bf7-6c3d-4997-bb92-97424f179a3a-2
00:00:10.604 --> 00:00:12.640
project and our project into.

fc61fea2-7b19-4d33-8fca-9f068c12e7f5-0
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.632
We want to make sure that it's
stored in an organised and easy

fc61fea2-7b19-4d33-8fca-9f068c12e7f5-1
00:00:16.632 --> 00:00:17.440
to access way.

e76f46bc-874a-437a-b2ca-574c326bde8d-0
00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:23.000
So hopefully you've been able to
download these materials.

6a1752fc-d290-44d6-9c43-7e67eb05982d-0
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.040
I've got them here in my
downloads.

8d43fc06-50ea-42a8-ac49-edbe81963f81-0
00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.751
If you downloaded them to
somewhere else then navigate to

8d43fc06-50ea-42a8-ac49-edbe81963f81-1
00:00:28.751 --> 00:00:32.360
where they are and now we're
going to create our folder.

fade1191-901f-47bf-a8b8-9cd1ee1445b2-0
00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.387
So I'm going to go into my
OneDrive and then into My

fade1191-901f-47bf-a8b8-9cd1ee1445b2-1
00:00:37.387 --> 00:00:41.640
Documents and I'm going to put
my folder in here.

d420f533-87d6-40c0-82ee-2867241bd8a1-0
00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:48.528
So I'm going to right click, go
on to new and then create a new

d420f533-87d6-40c0-82ee-2867241bd8a1-1
00:00:48.528 --> 00:00:53.480
folder and I'm going to name
this intro QGIS.

0d86dba7-15af-446c-a521-55c0b3a3bf45-0
00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:00.080
And now we have our folder where
we're going to put our materials

0d86dba7-15af-446c-a521-55c0b3a3bf45-1
00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:03.195
into you and we also have
somewhere to save our QGIS

0d86dba7-15af-446c-a521-55c0b3a3bf45-2
00:01:03.195 --> 00:01:03.960
project into.

04c86a80-d0df-4b93-aa26-7efc585dca3f-0
00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:08.347
So let's go into our download
and drag across the materials

04c86a80-d0df-4b93-aa26-7efc585dca3f-1
00:01:08.347 --> 00:01:12.408
that we downloaded and put it
into this folder we just created

04c86a80-d0df-4b93-aa26-7efc585dca3f-2
00:01:12.408 --> 00:01:15.760
and we can see that we have the
zipped folder here.

9a9fb8f3-6222-4d30-9680-65d4d8a82772-0
00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:22.290
And so what we're going to need
to do is unzip this folder and

9a9fb8f3-6222-4d30-9680-65d4d8a82772-1
00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:28.120
so to do that we can right click
on it and go on to extract all.

6116f413-a161-4446-8cf6-2912901e1075-0
00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:34.466
And when we get this pop up come
up you can just delete the part

6116f413-a161-4446-8cf6-2912901e1075-1
00:01:34.466 --> 00:01:38.019
that has the name of the folder
because this creates another

6116f413-a161-4446-8cf6-2912901e1075-2
00:01:38.019 --> 00:01:40.000
folder that we don't really
need.

c6e3731e-1abd-4e81-911b-b2e7976f0cd0-0
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.960
So we can just get rid of this
and click extract.

4fe8bf4e-8bb3-47ea-b087-9681bc996bb8-0
00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:56.773
So now we can see that we have a
unzipped folder and our zipped

4fe8bf4e-8bb3-47ea-b087-9681bc996bb8-1
00:01:56.773 --> 00:01:57.330
folder.

146d0cb7-b186-4680-a748-d2bd3cfca7ef-0
00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:03.474
So if we go into the unzipped
one, now we can see all the

146d0cb7-b186-4680-a748-d2bd3cfca7ef-1
00:02:03.474 --> 00:02:09.823
materials here that we're going
to use within this course and we

146d0cb7-b186-4680-a748-d2bd3cfca7ef-2
00:02:09.823 --> 00:02:15.488
can just delete the zipped one
because we don't need that

146d0cb7-b186-4680-a748-d2bd3cfca7ef-3
00:02:15.488 --> 00:02:16.269
anymore.

631e29f9-3640-4bc8-8d95-3ed05a8b7761-0
00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:24.733
An important thing to do is just
make sure that all your folders

631e29f9-3640-4bc8-8d95-3ed05a8b7761-1
00:02:24.733 --> 00:02:27.270
are named clearly so you know
what they are.

0ef12359-56fd-48ff-9d8e-34d9da90c34e-0
00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:31.227
So we're going to click on this
and then click again to change

0ef12359-56fd-48ff-9d8e-34d9da90c34e-1
00:02:31.227 --> 00:02:34.539
the name and we'll call it
materials so we know what this

0ef12359-56fd-48ff-9d8e-34d9da90c34e-2
00:02:34.539 --> 00:02:35.110
folder is.

6eaba7a4-1dab-4acc-b23e-6e7997cbe84b-0
00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.801
And so now we have our intro
QGIS folder and we have our

6eaba7a4-1dab-4acc-b23e-6e7997cbe84b-1
00:02:40.801 --> 00:02:42.960
materials folder within this.
