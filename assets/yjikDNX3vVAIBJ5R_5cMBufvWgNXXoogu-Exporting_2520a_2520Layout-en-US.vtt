049db7dd-5d27-409a-b5cb-d48609b4df18-0
00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:04.880
Now we've created our layout and
we've added some elements onto

049db7dd-5d27-409a-b5cb-d48609b4df18-1
00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:05.360
our map.

a6b244f0-9aba-4021-8a30-ddc1a58d1751-0
00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:09.320
It's looking ready to go ahead
and export it, so let's do that.

5952ec97-a562-4f20-b93a-bc57458a250b-0
00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:13.899
First of all, what we're going
to do is we're going to go into

5952ec97-a562-4f20-b93a-bc57458a250b-1
00:00:13.899 --> 00:00:17.680
layout, which is next to our
item properties here on the

5952ec97-a562-4f20-b93a-bc57458a250b-2
00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:21.925
right, and we're going to resize
our layout to fit the contents

5952ec97-a562-4f20-b93a-bc57458a250b-3
00:00:21.925 --> 00:00:23.120
within our layout.

fe56eace-aced-4686-a7f7-cd897894ee51-0
00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:26.170
And so it's just going to crop
off all the unnecessary white

fe56eace-aced-4686-a7f7-cd897894ee51-1
00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:26.720
background.

68496781-7424-4a07-b5f4-96422117b335-0
00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:31.050
So to do that, scroll down to
where it says resize layout to

68496781-7424-4a07-b5f4-96422117b335-1
00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.920
content and then we can click
resize layout.

761f32e6-a5f1-4881-a935-586ef273cdb5-0
00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.845
And this is just going to crop
out all of that unnecessary

761f32e6-a5f1-4881-a935-586ef273cdb5-1
00:00:36.845 --> 00:00:37.440
white space.

d8e0eb89-9294-4c1a-98b2-d55063c8b5d4-0
00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.280
And now we can go ahead and
export our map.

62b60b54-1c9a-43dd-8ec8-19c606ee842b-0
00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:46.325
So to do that, we're going to go
up into the top menu bar and

62b60b54-1c9a-43dd-8ec8-19c606ee842b-1
00:00:46.325 --> 00:00:50.821
click on Layout, and then down
towards the bottom we've got

62b60b54-1c9a-43dd-8ec8-19c606ee842b-2
00:00:50.821 --> 00:00:52.319
some export options.

1125e945-e46d-4f9b-a89c-d84a629398c7-0
00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:57.073
We're going to click Export as
image and now we're going to

1125e945-e46d-4f9b-a89c-d84a629398c7-1
00:00:57.073 --> 00:01:01.663
navigate to the folder that we
created and save our exported

1125e945-e46d-4f9b-a89c-d84a629398c7-2
00:01:01.663 --> 00:01:03.920
map into our materials folder.

1ccacd9e-3bae-48eb-8a6a-fb6e58d9e671-0
00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:09.021
So find that folder intro QGIS,
go into it, go into your

1ccacd9e-3bae-48eb-8a6a-fb6e58d9e671-1
00:01:09.021 --> 00:01:13.200
materials folder and then let's
name our layout.

a60d6bb7-28c0-4392-b948-3626deb98513-0
00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.885
So I'm just calling it Ziama
landscape layout and just

a60d6bb7-28c0-4392-b948-3626deb98513-1
00:01:17.885 --> 00:01:22.150
underneath you can choose what
kind of file type you want to

a60d6bb7-28c0-4392-b948-3626deb98513-2
00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:22.920
save it as.

2c53c4cd-456d-46d8-8020-5249f629a519-0
00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:28.443
So there's lots of options, but
I'm going to stick with JPEG and

2c53c4cd-456d-46d8-8020-5249f629a519-1
00:01:28.443 --> 00:01:33.409
now we can click save and this
is going to bring up our export

2c53c4cd-456d-46d8-8020-5249f629a519-2
00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:34.040
options.

5b5de8d6-f339-4007-97c7-df211a518a94-0
00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.760
And so here we can choose things
like export resolution.

c54853bf-ead7-465f-a411-a4cbbbacdd19-0
00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.080
This is at 300 which is normally
pretty good.

c654e0ae-a5d5-42ff-8d65-6225b898dd3b-0
00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:45.000
It normally should be around 200
to 300.

d9a14c26-f843-491a-b2a4-f1b25f2739d9-0
00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:49.819
We also have options for the
page width and heights and we

d9a14c26-f843-491a-b2a4-f1b25f2739d9-1
00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:52.320
can keep enable anti aliasing
on.

66184fcb-75a7-434f-9fb2-ac0632b6fdfa-0
00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.279
This is just a visualisation
effect that makes lines appear

66184fcb-75a7-434f-9fb2-ac0632b6fdfa-1
00:01:56.279 --> 00:02:00.436
less jagged, so we'll keep that
on and then we'll hit save and

66184fcb-75a7-434f-9fb2-ac0632b6fdfa-2
00:02:00.436 --> 00:02:02.680
that's going to export our
files.

ec406b16-86cf-4223-b893-d7632a1a60b1-0
00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:06.247
So now you could go into your
File Explorer and find where you

ec406b16-86cf-4223-b893-d7632a1a60b1-1
00:02:06.247 --> 00:02:08.400
saved it to in your materials
folder.

58eb1fa3-9023-4418-8d4e-6320b16665fa-0
00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:12.200
Or we can also click the link
that we have up here at the top.

415d5cec-37da-4039-936d-5531343185e6-0
00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:17.066
So let's click that and this
takes us to our materials

415d5cec-37da-4039-936d-5531343185e6-1
00:02:17.066 --> 00:02:17.640
folder.

65bdddd0-112c-4eae-ac38-cb85b168a4e0-0
00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:22.761
We can see our Ziama landscape
layout, so let's click on this

65bdddd0-112c-4eae-ac38-cb85b168a4e0-1
00:02:22.761 --> 00:02:24.000
and there we go.

9bea26d2-07ca-425e-8895-111e773dfc9f-0
00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.000
That's our exported map.

26097314-9694-4dcc-aa66-cc0a34bbde9e-0
00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.960
And so that's how to export your
layout in QGIS.
