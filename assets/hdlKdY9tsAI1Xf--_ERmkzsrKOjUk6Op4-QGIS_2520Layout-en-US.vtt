0f08fb13-e5d2-4cec-b393-6b5280a2aef5-0
00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:07.871
Now we've opened up QGIS and
we've had some time to get used

0f08fb13-e5d2-4cec-b393-6b5280a2aef5-1
00:00:07.871 --> 00:00:11.720
to the controls navigating
around our map frame.

a6480300-8ad9-492c-bc15-82e782d98f74-0
00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:15.440
Let's take a look at how this
software is laid out.

d5286391-7099-42e3-8ab6-329624350e62-0
00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.520
And so QGIS is split into some
main panels.

c135f016-9163-4892-a7f7-a9081395625d-0
00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:26.699
We have the browser panel here
on the left and underneath we've

c135f016-9163-4892-a7f7-a9081395625d-1
00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:32.239
got the layer list and then at
the top we have our menu bar and

c135f016-9163-4892-a7f7-a9081395625d-2
00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:36.999
our toolbars and then our map is
within our map frame.

b98d70d5-edfc-41f9-a457-a0f0def64d9c-0
00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:41.800
And last of all at the bottom we
have our status bar.

5a822817-f906-40f1-8882-5eb2b3bd5f17-0
00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:47.040
So let's take a look at the menu
and toolbars to begin with.

748ad9f9-4fab-4925-b451-e896ed3a3e6a-0
00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:53.888
The toolbar is where we have
quick buttons for accessing the

748ad9f9-4fab-4925-b451-e896ed3a3e6a-1
00:00:53.888 --> 00:00:56.160
tools to work with our data
layers.

d4c65a6a-af3f-42b4-9a04-2e7731363ea8-0
00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:00.047
The buttons here are actually
changeable, so we can right

d4c65a6a-af3f-42b4-9a04-2e7731363ea8-1
00:01:00.047 --> 00:01:03.715
click on the toolbar here and
then we can change what panels

d4c65a6a-af3f-42b4-9a04-2e7731363ea8-2
00:01:03.715 --> 00:01:05.519
or toolbars we have turned on.

be73ee5a-bb4c-41c6-9da1-c65b0bc86cd3-0
00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.800
So the panels are the other
windows that we can see.

1051d3df-8383-49b6-ac04-f0922034774b-0
00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:12.317
So our layers list for example,
we could turn that off and then

1051d3df-8383-49b6-ac04-f0922034774b-1
00:01:12.317 --> 00:01:15.120
we can see that it's disappeared
here on the left.

df0b4761-5fc6-4092-b878-9e7ac50c305e-0
00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.960
So we just right click again up
here.

bcdabcbc-ea69-40f7-b244-ab042c88069b-0
00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:22.967
We can turn that back on and
then the toolbars, these are all

bcdabcbc-ea69-40f7-b244-ab042c88069b-1
00:01:22.967 --> 00:01:26.440
the tools that we have within
our toolbar.

6eb652e0-7b11-431c-81c9-d7f1a2b71c50-0
00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:28.360
So we can turn these on and off
as well.

b1fc7220-4f9a-4684-85db-da06ec88a0e7-0
00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.314
So for example, the map
navigation toolbar, these are

b1fc7220-4f9a-4684-85db-da06ec88a0e7-1
00:01:31.314 --> 00:01:34.476
the buttons here that we've been
using to navigate around our

b1fc7220-4f9a-4684-85db-da06ec88a0e7-2
00:01:34.476 --> 00:01:34.680
map.

d0e66dd3-77a8-4588-ba10-cf8d0a59b6e1-0
00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.380
We could turn this toolbar off
and then we can see that those

d0e66dd3-77a8-4588-ba10-cf8d0a59b6e1-1
00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:40.640
buttons disappear.

95de2f68-5a14-47d8-ad72-3c70d41003f7-0
00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.297
We have a menu tab at the top of
the tool boxes here and we have

95de2f68-5a14-47d8-ad72-3c70d41003f7-1
00:01:50.297 --> 00:01:53.843
lots of different tabs which we
can click on and have a drop

95de2f68-5a14-47d8-ad72-3c70d41003f7-2
00:01:53.843 --> 00:01:57.040
down of choices for things to do
within that category.

015280c4-ad20-4ad5-ab96-2a6424f4678a-0
00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.560
We'll take a look at project to
start with.

d5d23103-2a0e-40b3-8f81-07c3fa961123-0
00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:03.079
So this is similar to project
within ArcGIS Pro if you're

d5d23103-2a0e-40b3-8f81-07c3fa961123-1
00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:06.596
familiar with that software, or
it's pretty similar to file

d5d23103-2a0e-40b3-8f81-07c3fa961123-2
00:02:06.596 --> 00:02:08.120
within Microsoft programs.

1a0515f5-d934-4636-8e37-551d670f7740-0
00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.920
So in here we could start a new
project, open an existing one.

19a317de-aa47-42af-a81a-b2d1f5fd7df0-0
00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.080
We've got our Save and Save As
options.

ccfcbf06-72f7-4a79-97e4-e94fbb9d55ba-0
00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:23.082
We also have more options in
here like accessing our project

ccfcbf06-72f7-4a79-97e4-e94fbb9d55ba-1
00:02:23.082 --> 00:02:29.444
properties, exporting our map or
project, and creating a new

ccfcbf06-72f7-4a79-97e4-e94fbb9d55ba-2
00:02:29.444 --> 00:02:30.800
print layout.

85813a8f-1b4e-4edd-9d33-c2ae3a67731d-0
00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.040
Now let's look at the Edit tab.

e23f7f6a-0832-436e-8092-a1ee4c74d4b5-0
00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:46.120
So Edit is also similar to the
Edit tab in Arcgis Pro.

adf92824-2725-4dbf-a324-227c401224bb-0
00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.760
This is where we can edit our
data layers once we've added

adf92824-2725-4dbf-a324-227c401224bb-1
00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:51.280
some data into our project.

781ddd38-ddcf-49d1-9916-f5a8e7f74415-0
00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.080
We have copy and paste functions
here.

81713f91-1e2d-4c9f-b13d-ea2a1ce24891-0
00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:01.549
We've got buttons to add, move
or delete features and we have

81713f91-1e2d-4c9f-b13d-ea2a1ce24891-1
00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:05.960
some other feature editing tools
as well in here.

dd4798d2-051a-467d-8b79-b1d66825ab6b-0
00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:14.267
In the View tab, we have some of
the same map navigation buttons

dd4798d2-051a-467d-8b79-b1d66825ab6b-1
00:03:14.267 --> 00:03:16.440
we've been using.

678b5a4d-5108-4c54-a322-bd909f01571c-0
00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:21.400
So the Pan map and also Zoom In
and zoom out options.

5b0ef6af-d137-4603-ad1c-ced8a1faa41f-0
00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:27.265
We have some measure tools in
here as well, and we also can

5b0ef6af-d137-4603-ad1c-ced8a1faa41f-1
00:03:27.265 --> 00:03:31.970
add decorations to our map so
these are like grid lines or

5b0ef6af-d137-4603-ad1c-ced8a1faa41f-2
00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:35.560
scale bars that we can add to
our map frame.

1c20f937-52bb-4fb5-b0fe-b3bfece44d84-0
00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:39.345
This isn't where we would go to
add these elements on a map that

1c20f937-52bb-4fb5-b0fe-b3bfece44d84-1
00:03:39.345 --> 00:03:41.480
we're preparing to export or
print though.

19fefec0-1e4e-4b25-8b48-8fe4898d0492-0
00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:45.000
You would need to create a print
layout to do that.

a227c434-411d-4db8-bf63-d95a869f1dbd-0
00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:48.320
We'll go over how to do this
within another video tutorial

c776ed14-eed5-4580-9563-1ee9ff36a782-0
00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:53.070
within this course. And in view,
we can also create a spatial

c776ed14-eed5-4580-9563-1ee9ff36a782-1
00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:53.760
bookmark.

4126b383-69af-4957-876e-fd7e2530d001-0
00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.480
So this is where we can save a
view within our map.

3375a662-e09c-454f-ba06-1f353e828455-0
00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:02.300
So for example, if we were
focusing on Italy, we could zoom

3375a662-e09c-454f-ba06-1f353e828455-1
00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:06.240
in on Italy here and have it
centred within our map.

f0524186-5c75-46b0-968f-a3533ae97fce-0
00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:09.260
And we want to save this view
because we want to go back to

f0524186-5c75-46b0-968f-a3533ae97fce-1
00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:09.400
it.

404628ab-893b-468c-a195-b7a388aee00b-0
00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:16.197
So to do that we can go back
into view, click on new spatial

404628ab-893b-468c-a195-b7a388aee00b-1
00:04:16.197 --> 00:04:18.400
bookmark and name it.

21b31198-20d8-4f30-a57d-4da01df9b3c0-0
00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:23.410
So we'll just name it Italy and
then we can choose whether we

21b31198-20d8-4f30-a57d-4da01df9b3c0-1
00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:26.400
want to save it into user
bookmarks.

d63bce28-f7df-47ab-803a-6805639e8d44-0
00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:31.655
So this will save it into QGIS
to use in every project that we

d63bce28-f7df-47ab-803a-6805639e8d44-1
00:04:31.655 --> 00:04:36.000
work in, or we could also save
it in Project Bookmark.

f4278e53-1f5e-448c-b0f1-d4c1dc36de15-0
00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:41.290
So this will save it for just
your current project to be able

f4278e53-1f5e-448c-b0f1-d4c1dc36de15-1
00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:42.920
to access that view.

33a61888-f70f-4d6d-b1cd-d5b10505be55-0
00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:47.181
So we'll just save it into our
project bookmarks and then click

33a61888-f70f-4d6d-b1cd-d5b10505be55-1
00:04:47.181 --> 00:04:47.480
save.

5609c147-8516-4650-b580-2b5625fd9adc-0
00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:51.982
And then if we take a look in
our browser window on the left,

5609c147-8516-4650-b580-2b5625fd9adc-1
00:04:51.982 --> 00:04:54.840
we can see we have a tab here
for Spatial Bookmarks.

f6e31b73-4102-4d9d-a91f-e9d4e76854f4-0
00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:58.280
So we can click on the arrow to
open it up.

72867ef5-8c48-409c-a41f-4cdc78253a06-0
00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:02.252
And then if we go into Project
Bookmarks, here is our Italy

72867ef5-8c48-409c-a41f-4cdc78253a06-1
00:05:02.252 --> 00:05:03.920
bookmark that we've created.

7871413e-4494-4e73-855c-e1eba0eb2bfb-0
00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:07.733
So if we were to end up in a
different place in our map and

7871413e-4494-4e73-855c-e1eba0eb2bfb-1
00:05:07.733 --> 00:05:11.204
we wanted to go back to the view
that we saved, we just need to

7871413e-4494-4e73-855c-e1eba0eb2bfb-2
00:05:11.204 --> 00:05:14.621
click on this in our browser and
it takes us back to this view

7871413e-4494-4e73-855c-e1eba0eb2bfb-3
00:05:14.621 --> 00:05:15.760
that we had of Italy.

1fe906e3-c4f7-42ba-a20d-7c0376112ff5-0
00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:21.240
So pause this video here and
have a go at saving your own

1fe906e3-c4f7-42ba-a20d-7c0376112ff5-1
00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:25.480
bookmark for any country or
location of your choice.

b6b528cc-f139-41ee-be16-8c522b655702-0
00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:30.481
In view, we also have options
for showing or hiding layers,

b6b528cc-f139-41ee-be16-8c522b655702-1
00:05:30.481 --> 00:05:35.733
and we can also turn our panels
or toolbars on and off in here

b6b528cc-f139-41ee-be16-8c522b655702-2
00:05:35.733 --> 00:05:36.400
as well.

629d8a7d-e4bb-41b6-81ac-a5ff8f95fa09-0
00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:40.400
And next we'll take a look at
the Layer tab.

6862bdd8-ed84-487e-bfd3-7e73454fd34f-0
00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:47.092
So in layer we have the Data
Source Manager where we can have

6862bdd8-ed84-487e-bfd3-7e73454fd34f-1
00:05:47.092 --> 00:05:52.141
access for opening all of our
file based data, our databases

6862bdd8-ed84-487e-bfd3-7e73454fd34f-2
00:05:52.141 --> 00:05:53.879
and our web services.

ffb3b53b-68d7-4a17-8c33-320a7e9afdfd-0
00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:58.880
We can use Layer to also add and
create data layers here.

eec77dc8-5632-4919-8359-7979030737b0-0
00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:04.989
We have options for copying and
pasting data layers, and we can

eec77dc8-5632-4919-8359-7979030737b0-1
00:06:04.989 --> 00:06:11.003
open our attribute table for our
layers and also look at layer

eec77dc8-5632-4919-8359-7979030737b0-2
00:06:11.003 --> 00:06:16.635
properties here which we'll be
going over later on in this

eec77dc8-5632-4919-8359-7979030737b0-3
00:06:16.635 --> 00:06:22.839
course. Looking at settings, we
have Style Manager here and this

eec77dc8-5632-4919-8359-7979030737b0-4
00:06:22.839 --> 00:06:28.280
is where we can manage and
create styles for the symbols

eec77dc8-5632-4919-8359-7979030737b0-5
00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:31.239
that represent our data layers.

1219d949-6275-431f-94f7-45b4985fdae8-0
00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:36.281
We can also create custom
projections in here and we have

1219d949-6275-431f-94f7-45b4985fdae8-1
00:06:36.281 --> 00:06:39.400
options for setting keyboard
shortcuts.

ebb8d5a9-a7d5-40bf-b95f-faf494ccaeb9-0
00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:44.617
In the options window we can
choose specific preferences for

ebb8d5a9-a7d5-40bf-b95f-faf494ccaeb9-1
00:06:44.617 --> 00:06:47.960
how we want our QGIS platform to
look and run.

3568da97-f08f-4007-a250-bb45e84d8733-0
00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:53.270
We've already taken a look at
Plug Insurance, so this is where

3568da97-f08f-4007-a250-bb45e84d8733-1
00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:57.000
we can manage and install
external software for QGIS.

1b453605-87cc-437e-9a62-b4a0665ac06e-0
00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.240
And Python Console allows us to
run script.

d71bceed-efc0-4fc4-91d9-81d0f07a4e2f-0
00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:06.229
The Vector tab has all of our
tools for our vector data layers

d71bceed-efc0-4fc4-91d9-81d0f07a4e2f-1
00:07:06.229 --> 00:07:11.979
and we have all the options here
for vector data and in raster

d71bceed-efc0-4fc4-91d9-81d0f07a4e2f-2
00:07:11.979 --> 00:07:17.272
it's the same but for our raster
data layers. We have the

d71bceed-efc0-4fc4-91d9-81d0f07a4e2f-3
00:07:17.272 --> 00:07:22.748
database tab which has our
database manager in where we can

d71bceed-efc0-4fc4-91d9-81d0f07a4e2f-4
00:07:22.748 --> 00:07:28.498
add and manage our geodatabases
and then in web we can see our

d71bceed-efc0-4fc4-91d9-81d0f07a4e2f-5
00:07:28.498 --> 00:07:29.319
plugins. 

fec2ca1f-3def-4257-9e5d-d2b782a9b822-0
00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:33.080
In Mesh, we can perform mesh
layer calculations and in

fec2ca1f-3def-4257-9e5d-d2b782a9b822-1
00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:35.200
processing we have our toolbox.

a9781967-d519-4f80-90e4-cf32b4419592-0
00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:38.847
So this is where we can access
all of our geoprocessing tools

a9781967-d519-4f80-90e4-cf32b4419592-1
00:07:38.847 --> 00:07:41.200
that we might need within our
projects.

9680b424-1b0d-4963-b6b8-4646df2102bf-0
00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:44.840
The help tab is pretty
self-explanatory.

e4f06875-94c2-4d9e-a852-caf6f6629c16-0
00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:49.957
We have the help contents in
here which takes us to an online

e4f06875-94c2-4d9e-a852-caf6f6629c16-1
00:07:49.957 --> 00:07:54.482
QGIS help page and underneath
our menu we have all of our

e4f06875-94c2-4d9e-a852-caf6f6629c16-2
00:07:54.482 --> 00:07:59.397
toolbars and as I said, this is
customizable to whatever tools

e4f06875-94c2-4d9e-a852-caf6f6629c16-3
00:07:59.397 --> 00:08:02.439
that you want to have quick
access to.

dd3b67b5-13b9-462b-bf5e-7b7cc373662e-0
00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:07.400
Next we'll take a look at the
browser panel on the left.

434722ef-cc68-4221-a150-332a76c0a477-0
00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:12.079
So in here this is where we can
navigate to our connected

434722ef-cc68-4221-a150-332a76c0a477-1
00:08:12.079 --> 00:08:16.328
directories and folders and we
can use this to add data into

434722ef-cc68-4221-a150-332a76c0a477-2
00:08:16.328 --> 00:08:19.880
our map frame and also to
connect to geodatabases.

33937338-0b20-4861-929f-294039d461b4-0
00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:23.732
We have the layers list
underneath and so this is where

33937338-0b20-4861-929f-294039d461b4-1
00:08:23.732 --> 00:08:26.603
we can see all of our data
layers that we have within our

33937338-0b20-4861-929f-294039d461b4-2
00:08:26.603 --> 00:08:27.000
project.

768b5c7a-7c97-4542-8a68-9bd9da056cb8-0
00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:30.416
At the moment we can only see
our basemap because this is the

768b5c7a-7c97-4542-8a68-9bd9da056cb8-1
00:08:30.416 --> 00:08:32.120
only thing we have in our
project.

473b2427-7eaf-49a3-b17c-af773660f30a-0
00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:35.706
But once we add some more data
in, it will come up within the

473b2427-7eaf-49a3-b17c-af773660f30a-1
00:08:35.706 --> 00:08:36.800
the layers list here.

fb95b80b-82bd-4f8e-91c3-e07f61f7eae8-0
00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:40.855
We can right click on the data
layers within here and then we

fb95b80b-82bd-4f8e-91c3-e07f61f7eae8-1
00:08:40.855 --> 00:08:43.865
can see a menu with extra
options particular for that

fb95b80b-82bd-4f8e-91c3-e07f61f7eae8-2
00:08:43.865 --> 00:08:44.200
layer.

3ff46ae6-429f-49ac-b4f3-4dfdaa8794ff-0
00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:50.680
The next panel to mention is the
map canvas.

7283bc89-cf8f-4f7f-b9be-5ae457399175-0
00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:51.880
This is straightforward.

7e66994e-8816-48d9-b1d2-8f4e38f72fde-0
00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:55.356
So this is where we see our data
displayed and we can navigate,

7e66994e-8816-48d9-b1d2-8f4e38f72fde-1
00:08:55.356 --> 00:08:57.040
zoom and interact with it here.

38a7736a-b14d-45e5-a051-59eda199c5fa-0
00:08:57.880 --> 00:09:00.680
And the last thing to mention is
the status bar at the bottom.

b7a98b3e-d4db-48e1-a5ca-5ba0a61697af-0
00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:03.600
So this shows us the current
information about our map.

460c4c53-76dc-46ee-b4c9-d2a4a1527959-0
00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:09.362
We have the coordinates of our
cursor, for example, and it also

460c4c53-76dc-46ee-b4c9-d2a4a1527959-1
00:09:09.362 --> 00:09:14.727
shows us the map scale, the zoom
extent, the rotation and in the

460c4c53-76dc-46ee-b4c9-d2a4a1527959-2
00:09:14.727 --> 00:09:19.680
corner we can see the coordinate
system that our map is in.

295846d5-b9d7-46b8-a8dc-d27788c8efe1-0
00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:23.956
And so there you go, that's the
main layout of QGIS where to

295846d5-b9d7-46b8-a8dc-d27788c8efe1-1
00:09:23.956 --> 00:09:27.789
access the different buttons and
what each window you can see is

295846d5-b9d7-46b8-a8dc-d27788c8efe1-2
00:09:27.789 --> 00:09:28.320
used for.
