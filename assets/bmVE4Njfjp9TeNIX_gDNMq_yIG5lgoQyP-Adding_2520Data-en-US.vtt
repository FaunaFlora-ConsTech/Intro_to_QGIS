00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:05.751
Now that we've been introduced
to the QGIS interface and we

2d32183c-d79a-4343-88ca-0d79de0b73fd-1
00:00:05.751 --> 00:00:10.274
have our materials organised and
ready to go, let's add some data

2d32183c-d79a-4343-88ca-0d79de0b73fd-2
00:00:10.274 --> 00:00:11.440
into our project.

d4c69838-c041-4a75-9041-c42bfbd8ce5e-0
00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.507
To do this we're going to
utilise the browser window here

d4c69838-c041-4a75-9041-c42bfbd8ce5e-1
00:00:15.507 --> 00:00:16.200
on the left.

1056f70e-9569-45f6-bd5e-8450539dee92-0
00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.716
This browser acts as a mini File
Explorer and so we can access

1056f70e-9569-45f6-bd5e-8450539dee92-1
00:00:20.716 --> 00:00:23.600
our computer files and folders
through this.

9d1855a8-67ad-4ab4-8207-98e577b421e1-0
00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:29.657
In this browser window we can
navigate to where we saved our

9d1855a8-67ad-4ab4-8207-98e577b421e1-1
00:00:29.657 --> 00:00:30.360
materials to.

cdb03c90-d744-4ada-a588-c7db3d251b74-0
00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:36.170
So I'm going to go into home
here and now I can access my

cdb03c90-d744-4ada-a588-c7db3d251b74-1
00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.960
OneDrive.

ee0245ad-5c3b-46d3-b143-56a90caa3144-0
00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:42.140
So we can open that up using the
arrow on the left and then in

ee0245ad-5c3b-46d3-b143-56a90caa3144-1
00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:42.880
Documents,

d4522f56-b708-4ba7-9710-3107d3a45244-0
00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:46.739
and then there we go, there's
our folder we created intro

d4522f56-b708-4ba7-9710-3107d3a45244-1
00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:47.000
QGIS.

9b60df8f-0c6d-4c15-9cae-03b211588be4-0
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.840
So let's open this up and now we
can see our materials.

ef941bc4-4d64-42ff-981c-e123c6eff145-0
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.480
So we can open up our materials
folder as well.

ba3db56b-d245-4907-99f1-6cb96fc394ee-0
00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.760
And now we can see the materials
within this folder.

0dbe3f13-1b11-4c91-8f39-e9521f5e4452-0
00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.200
So we've got our different data
layers here.

60e21c16-3524-4884-afe4-8c96fb45ffa1-0
00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.920
We want to start adding these
into our project.

160aab4f-a0bf-46fd-be90-ee3d5b62c990-0
00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:12.061
And so to do that, we're going
to click on the biomonitoring

160aab4f-a0bf-46fd-be90-ee3d5b62c990-1
00:01:12.061 --> 00:01:18.083
Ziama 2019 points and then we
can click and hold and drag it

160aab4f-a0bf-46fd-be90-ee3d5b62c990-2
00:01:18.083 --> 00:01:21.440
and then drop into our map
frame.

39949a47-2eee-4249-af77-8db81747ab52-0
00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:26.040
And now we've added that data
layer into our map.

49849bc5-3e90-411f-a258-b305b234ce5a-0
00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:29.851
But you can see that we're
really zoomed out, so we can't

49849bc5-3e90-411f-a258-b305b234ce5a-1
00:01:29.851 --> 00:01:31.440
really see this data layer.

8a8b5f85-ec0f-4815-b483-7960355419ab-0
00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:36.120
So to be able to see it clearly,
we can right click on the layer

8a8b5f85-ec0f-4815-b483-7960355419ab-1
00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:40.088
and click zoom to layer and now
we're zoomed in on all of our

8a8b5f85-ec0f-4815-b483-7960355419ab-2
00:01:40.088 --> 00:01:43.160
points and we can see every
single one of them.

49d8f725-88d2-4cf8-84de-e315f9b76c98-0
00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:49.680
We're now going to have a go at
adding in another data layer.

c6243652-f64a-47e4-9ba8-ec7868c24a19-0
00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:53.489
So we're going to find the Ziama
landscape shape file, We're

c6243652-f64a-47e4-9ba8-ec7868c24a19-1
00:01:53.489 --> 00:01:56.376
going to click on it and then
we're going to do the same

c6243652-f64a-47e4-9ba8-ec7868c24a19-2
00:01:56.376 --> 00:01:56.680
thing.

290bde17-4cd1-41f9-9115-bfebbc12a24b-0
00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:59.600
We're going to drag it into our
map canvas.

34625325-1311-468a-a73a-201b735ccf24-0
00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.132
And now we have our protected
area of Ziama added into our

34625325-1311-468a-a73a-201b735ccf24-1
00:02:05.132 --> 00:02:05.440
map.

29d4667c-68d9-455c-b347-c06cd10bed8c-0
00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:11.395
So we can see them on our map
frame, but we can also see them

29d4667c-68d9-455c-b347-c06cd10bed8c-1
00:02:11.395 --> 00:02:12.640
in our layers list now.

f68c3db6-6351-4747-8d57-e52fe5bdb713-0
00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:18.720
And so in the layers list we can
use the toggle boxes next to the

f68c3db6-6351-4747-8d57-e52fe5bdb713-1
00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:24.000
names of the layers to turn them
on and off, and we can also drag

f68c3db6-6351-4747-8d57-e52fe5bdb713-2
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.880
them up and down to decide which
layer we want on top of the

f68c3db6-6351-4747-8d57-e52fe5bdb713-3
00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:29.360
other.

f9f8a053-b4af-48b5-b9d6-ceb9e0348e5d-0
00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:33.360
And there you go.

9cc167d2-38df-4928-9e45-3518af382ac3-0
00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.600
That's how to add data into a
QGIS project.
