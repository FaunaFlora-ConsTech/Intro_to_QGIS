00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:05.780
Now we have our materials
organised in an easy to access

d2bd687b-2724-4fe8-be76-1722d0192ed9-1
00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:10.280
folder and hopefully you have
downloaded QGIS we can begin our

d2bd687b-2724-4fe8-be76-1722d0192ed9-2
00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:11.280
first project.

eb18f611-291b-46da-835c-305dc620f458-0
00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:15.854
We're going to open up QGIS. I
have it here on my desktop, but

eb18f611-291b-46da-835c-305dc620f458-1
00:00:15.854 --> 00:00:19.518
if you don't just look it up in
your computer search bar and

eb18f611-291b-46da-835c-305dc620f458-2
00:00:19.518 --> 00:00:20.540
find where it is.

3616e6fc-27fe-41dc-98a8-564717ca3c65-0
00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:23.260
So I'm going to click on it to
open it up

6433b48d-3b8f-40ac-af4a-4bd089b66983-0
00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.594
and this is the page you'll be
greeted with when you open it

6433b48d-3b8f-40ac-af4a-4bd089b66983-1
00:00:27.594 --> 00:00:27.740
up.

fd2a5dca-3367-4c36-964e-ed7674909758-0
00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:32.738
We can go into Project Templates
and click on New Empty Project

fd2a5dca-3367-4c36-964e-ed7674909758-1
00:00:32.738 --> 00:00:33.350
to begin.

c7e9e139-8421-4e85-ab46-e27ee982a28d-0
00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:40.333
The first thing we're going to
do is save our project into the

c7e9e139-8421-4e85-ab46-e27ee982a28d-1
00:00:40.333 --> 00:00:44.317
folder that we created before,
so go on to the Project tab,

c7e9e139-8421-4e85-ab46-e27ee982a28d-2
00:00:44.317 --> 00:00:45.380
click on save as

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:50.677
and then navigate to the folder
we created. So for me it was in

443c4593-f860-4b10-bb6f-b15cff589e2a-1
00:00:50.677 --> 00:00:51.440
my OneDrive,

ac299115-6855-4873-b412-222bc3684a8f-0
00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.660
in my Documents

ab10a314-3020-47cb-8fde-a6181997ca12-0
00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:57.980
and here it is intro QGIS. So
I'm going to go into here

d946ea3a-ebe3-496c-89a1-bb211cdb1cd4-0
00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:05.070
and I'm going to name my project
Intro Project

cd7d61ac-9f33-4b67-a319-d353b587cec9-0
00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:09.810
and then hit save.

35e5b642-b3e4-4afa-9c67-0883254761a9-0
00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:17.409
And now what we're going to do
is add a basemap into our map

35e5b642-b3e4-4afa-9c67-0883254761a9-1
00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:21.072
project. So to do this we're
going to need to install a

35e5b642-b3e4-4afa-9c67-0883254761a9-2
00:01:21.072 --> 00:01:25.192
plugin called QuickMapServices
that has a lot of basemaps that

35e5b642-b3e4-4afa-9c67-0883254761a9-3
00:01:25.192 --> 00:01:29.116
are freely available for us to
use. So plugins are external

35e5b642-b3e4-4afa-9c67-0883254761a9-4
00:01:29.116 --> 00:01:33.106
software that we can add into
QGIS. To add QuickMapServices,

35e5b642-b3e4-4afa-9c67-0883254761a9-5
00:01:33.106 --> 00:01:36.179

which will bring this window up
and then in the search bar we

bae010a8-1566-47e6-8f6e-994ffb5a0f08-1
00:01:48.276 --> 00:01:50.000
can type in QuickMapServices

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:57.900
and here it has come up. So
we're going to click on it

f244218b-0b9f-4a28-8655-db2d29628253-0
00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:01.800

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:08.540
and wait for it to load up.

df4caf0a-d3e7-40b7-b140-977e78c47720-0
00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:14.409
OK great, so now it's loaded up.
We can go and access this plugin

df4caf0a-d3e7-40b7-b140-977e78c47720-1
00:02:14.409 --> 00:02:18.857
by either clicking on the globe

df4caf0a-d3e7-40b7-b140-977e78c47720-2
00:02:18.857 --> 00:02:21.470
we can see it's for
QuickMapServices

8e1b1dc1-297f-4681-8919-8c6102c6ceab-0
00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:23.830
or we can go into the web tab

4d0f03bf-4557-4ab9-9aca-30fab41f587a-0

ffbc5d27-2ddb-4ac2-876c-f08216b2f785-0
00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:34.770
So at the moment we have access
to some NASA data and OSM data.

ffbc5d27-2ddb-4ac2-876c-f08216b2f785-1
00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:38.940
We can access even more by going
into Settings,

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.250

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:47.915
and then the Get Contributed

ae0d6b67-78ba-4839-a15f-217702398554-1
00:02:47.915 --> 00:02:51.518
that and wait for it to load up.
There we go, we've got it

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:58.696
So now if we go back to our
QuickMapServices, so in web, and

caaca6ff-458b-4004-a84a-49ac68c7080c-1
00:02:58.696 --> 00:03:03.039

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:09.637
So we're going to load up a base
map from ESRI. So we'll go into

fa0841c6-4b1c-4da2-9a53-f209eb03e054-1
00:03:09.637 --> 00:03:10.300

e0fb7c39-d300-4be1-a545-660334153848-1
00:03:14.669 --> 00:03:18.486
and there you go. It's going to
load up. So we have our base map

e0fb7c39-d300-4be1-a545-660334153848-2
00:03:18.486 --> 00:03:22.009
