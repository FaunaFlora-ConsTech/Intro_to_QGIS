2987bce3-aa47-4d90-9f4c-d87a9a9d5493-0
00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:05.296
Now that we know how to look at
the symbology of our vector data

2987bce3-aa47-4d90-9f4c-d87a9a9d5493-1
00:00:05.296 --> 00:00:08.975
layers and change these to how
we want, we're going to take a

2987bce3-aa47-4d90-9f4c-d87a9a9d5493-2
00:00:08.975 --> 00:00:12.120
look at changing the symbology
of our raster layers.

3ea34220-908a-46a5-ae9e-a5f17fd923d9-0
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:17.114
So let's toggle off the vector
data layers and just have a look

3ea34220-908a-46a5-ae9e-a5f17fd923d9-1
00:00:17.114 --> 00:00:20.360
at our two rasters, Land Cover
and elevation.

d3764ca0-6a13-4276-bfa0-8e992c5538c9-0
00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:28.473
We can tell that these are
rasters because if we zoom in on

d3764ca0-6a13-4276-bfa0-8e992c5538c9-1
00:00:28.473 --> 00:00:34.212
them in our map frame, we can
see that they're layers made-up

d3764ca0-6a13-4276-bfa0-8e992c5538c9-2
00:00:34.212 --> 00:00:38.840
of lots of different pixels of
different colours.

ead3c7e2-0d8b-4073-aa4c-db26c452f60f-0
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.017
So it's the same for the
elevation layer as well, we just

ead3c7e2-0d8b-4073-aa4c-db26c452f60f-1
00:00:45.017 --> 00:00:49.589
need to zoom in a bit further to
see the different pixels, as the

ead3c7e2-0d8b-4073-aa4c-db26c452f60f-2
00:00:49.589 --> 00:00:52.360
pixels in this layer are a bit
smaller.

98e27022-fe19-4fec-a49a-cc74aa0f2f1e-0
00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.022
And now we'll take a look at
changing the symbology for this

98e27022-fe19-4fec-a49a-cc74aa0f2f1e-1
00:00:59.022 --> 00:00:59.920
elevation layer.

485f2520-6f44-4ef1-b7eb-8b47d1371726-0
00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.440
So stay with the elevation layer
toggled on.

1abea301-0656-4478-add8-f110b07bc1e9-0
00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:07.153
And what we're going to do is
we're going to right click on

1abea301-0656-4478-add8-f110b07bc1e9-1
00:01:07.153 --> 00:01:10.111
the layer and click zoom to
layer so we can see the full

1abea301-0656-4478-add8-f110b07bc1e9-2
00:01:10.111 --> 00:01:11.719
extent of the elevation raster.

10bc983b-deb8-47bb-b0c1-051de0f27389-0
00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:19.840
And now looking in our layers
list, we can see that for this

10bc983b-deb8-47bb-b0c1-051de0f27389-1
00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:24.520
layer we have a black box for
zero and a white box for 1386.

3e357fd7-e2e2-4272-84f7-a5b2c319f1a9-0
00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:30.622
So this is a continuous raster
layer as we have elevation going

3e357fd7-e2e2-4272-84f7-a5b2c319f1a9-1
00:01:30.622 --> 00:01:35.486
from zero to 1386 meters and so
each pixel is representing a

3e357fd7-e2e2-4272-84f7-a5b2c319f1a9-2
00:01:35.486 --> 00:01:37.400
value within this range.

bd2ac4bf-fa0a-405b-aa55-260460e93cbb-0
00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:41.457
This means that white is
representing the highest

bd2ac4bf-fa0a-405b-aa55-260460e93cbb-1
00:01:41.457 --> 00:01:45.992
elevation in our landscape which
is 1386 meters, and black is

bd2ac4bf-fa0a-405b-aa55-260460e93cbb-2
00:01:45.992 --> 00:01:48.480
representing the lowest 0
meters.

818bf7ef-6050-4dfd-a1b8-3adbe1327474-0
00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:52.694
So all the elevation heights we
have in our landscape are being

818bf7ef-6050-4dfd-a1b8-3adbe1327474-1
00:01:52.694 --> 00:01:55.040
represented on a scale of black
to white.

2873d9e7-05c0-4e80-b7d8-570d2f093092-0
00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.144
Now let's open up the symbology
tab just by double clicking on

2873d9e7-05c0-4e80-b7d8-570d2f093092-1
00:02:00.144 --> 00:02:00.720
our layer.

b2a2b7ac-b512-4742-8220-c903894bdb0e-0
00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:06.391
So the symbology tab for raster
layers looks slightly different

b2a2b7ac-b512-4742-8220-c903894bdb0e-1
00:02:06.391 --> 00:02:10.382
in the top drop down box though
we can still choose the type of

b2a2b7ac-b512-4742-8220-c903894bdb0e-2
00:02:10.382 --> 00:02:13.937
symbology that we want to
represent our layer and at the

b2a2b7ac-b512-4742-8220-c903894bdb0e-3
00:02:13.937 --> 00:02:16.120
moment we have a single band
grey.

37625cc1-9a4c-4163-af37-09e734a83c84-0
00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.520
This is what's giving our black
to white colour ramp.

bcfa2a67-fcdb-4771-a777-f0801e40936e-0
00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.584
Let's change this to single band
pseudo colour to have more

bcfa2a67-fcdb-4771-a777-f0801e40936e-1
00:02:23.584 --> 00:02:24.520
colour options.

26fa7b3c-6e1d-45f0-bb7d-102e472a1fe2-0
00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:35.257
So now to change the colour we
can go into the colour ramp drop

26fa7b3c-6e1d-45f0-bb7d-102e472a1fe2-1
00:02:35.257 --> 00:02:41.870
down box and we can see we have
some colour options here.

2e23ed55-8dd0-4010-a1b8-538ea8225160-0
00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:45.930
But we're going to hover over
all colour ramps to get even

2e23ed55-8dd0-4010-a1b8-538ea8225160-1
00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:49.510
more options and then we're
going to click on BRBG.

7b10706e-1a4e-46c4-969a-84b34f261c06-0
00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:55.967
And now if we hit apply this is
going to apply this colour ramp

7b10706e-1a4e-46c4-969a-84b34f261c06-1
00:02:55.967 --> 00:02:56.710
to our layer.

6b25165b-2dc6-47e0-824a-fd7de7dbaf3d-0
00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.912
And actually this has given us
the inverse of what we want

6b25165b-2dc6-47e0-824a-fd7de7dbaf3d-1
00:03:01.912 --> 00:03:05.288
because we want the bluey colour
to be the lowest elevation and

6b25165b-2dc6-47e0-824a-fd7de7dbaf3d-2
00:03:05.288 --> 00:03:07.240
the Orangey brown to be the
highest.

d5d7175d-92ae-4899-b1e0-09f4ea170a63-0
00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:10.819
So to change it we're going to
click on the drop down box in

d5d7175d-92ae-4899-b1e0-09f4ea170a63-1
00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:13.986
the colour ramp section and
click on Invert Colour ramp and

d5d7175d-92ae-4899-b1e0-09f4ea170a63-2
00:03:13.986 --> 00:03:16.520
hit apply and there we go,
that's what we want.

8ba127e7-abaa-4952-975a-0b5ff0dc06e9-0
00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:20.382
So now we have a symbology
that's representing elevation

8ba127e7-abaa-4952-975a-0b5ff0dc06e9-1
00:03:20.382 --> 00:03:24.719
much better and it's a lot more
clear what this rattle layer is

8ba127e7-abaa-4952-975a-0b5ff0dc06e9-2
00:03:24.719 --> 00:03:25.600
representing.

f351b6a9-9844-4b00-bf92-c1865a2569f7-0
00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:32.084
So now we're going to take a
look at our land cover layer so

f351b6a9-9844-4b00-bf92-c1865a2569f7-1
00:03:32.084 --> 00:03:35.320
we can toggle off the elevation
and turn on land cover.

98304a95-2971-492f-9b0a-639174810387-0
00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:39.360
And this land cover layer is a
discrete raster.

438cc4bd-1abb-4a1f-976e-cbd1cd8bfe23-0
00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:42.734
And that's because we have 9
categories of different land

438cc4bd-1abb-4a1f-976e-cbd1cd8bfe23-1
00:03:42.734 --> 00:03:43.400
cover types.

70b2d023-f6f9-48df-9712-e15d28fcab28-0
00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.598
And so each pixel is
representing one of these

70b2d023-f6f9-48df-9712-e15d28fcab28-1
00:03:46.598 --> 00:03:47.840
discrete categories.

33df95b9-0f09-4d4a-800b-a24426804591-0
00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:53.651
So let's go into the symbology
window again by double clicking

33df95b9-0f09-4d4a-800b-a24426804591-1
00:03:53.651 --> 00:03:55.600
and going into the symbology
tab.

127254ee-1618-4a35-9e26-e7be57706533-0
00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:00.720
We need to go in this render
type drop down box again.

7eb5d061-4d55-4319-a902-0a914b03f9f3-0
00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:04.887
So at the moment we have a
single band Gray symbology, but

7eb5d061-4d55-4319-a902-0a914b03f9f3-1
00:04:04.887 --> 00:04:08.526
this isn't representing our
discrete raster very well so

7eb5d061-4d55-4319-a902-0a914b03f9f3-2
00:04:08.526 --> 00:04:11.400
we're going to change this to
unique values.

f65978ed-3ff9-4f89-b9b0-046772fcacbd-0
00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:16.063
We can leave our colour ramp as
random colours as we're going to

f65978ed-3ff9-4f89-b9b0-046772fcacbd-1
00:04:16.063 --> 00:04:19.240
choose which colours we want for
each pixel category.

a49a43a9-70f0-4f16-893b-49b13caabeb9-0
00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:25.004
And now we're going to click on
the plus button here to add some

a49a43a9-70f0-4f16-893b-49b13caabeb9-1
00:04:25.004 --> 00:04:26.240
pixel categories.

204a30bc-38b6-4400-b8d4-aec676b9679b-0
00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:33.930
So we're going to click 9 times
to add our nine different land

204a30bc-38b6-4400-b8d4-aec676b9679b-1
00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:38.400
cover types so you can see them
here.

82441c8c-d70b-4b8a-973c-fcad031be942-0
00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:42.799
And now we can start changing
each color to represent what

82441c8c-d70b-4b8a-973c-fcad031be942-1
00:04:42.799 --> 00:04:44.440
land cover type it is.

337a7fcd-c048-4d66-b9ca-768ba33fd7a7-0
00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:49.702
So for the first category 0,
this is representing where

337a7fcd-c048-4d66-b9ca-768ba33fd7a7-1
00:04:49.702 --> 00:04:51.000
there's no data.

84b4659f-151e-479c-923e-369e3cccaa42-0
00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:56.100
So we can change the color to be
no color just by double clicking

84b4659f-151e-479c-923e-369e3cccaa42-1
00:04:56.100 --> 00:05:00.470
on the color and we'll just
change the opacity to 0% and

84b4659f-151e-479c-923e-369e3cccaa42-2
00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:01.160
click OK.

15568d99-fbb2-47fc-8bcf-e96c5a984a46-0
00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:04.961
And so now we've got a
completely transparent colour

15568d99-fbb2-47fc-8bcf-e96c5a984a46-1
00:05:04.961 --> 00:05:09.244
and in label we can change this
by double clicking and we'll

15568d99-fbb2-47fc-8bcf-e96c5a984a46-2
00:05:09.244 --> 00:05:11.000
change it to say no data.

f3c0dc20-56c9-44a0-853a-64ea7e678b1a-0
00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:15.360
We'll hit apply and OK.

098cc6df-8b94-4510-9c9a-b9b6a304c2da-0
00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:21.006
And now if we look back in our
layers list and just open up the

098cc6df-8b94-4510-9c9a-b9b6a304c2da-1
00:05:21.006 --> 00:05:24.811
arrow to see our land cover
symbology, we can see that the

098cc6df-8b94-4510-9c9a-b9b6a304c2da-2
00:05:24.811 --> 00:05:29.002
first category is No Colour and
it's got a label to tell us that

098cc6df-8b94-4510-9c9a-b9b6a304c2da-3
00:05:29.002 --> 00:05:31.840
this is representing where
there's no data.

d3b1df16-980a-4183-b4eb-e398da844b37-0
00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:37.169
Now have a go at changing the
rest of the pixel colours and

d3b1df16-980a-4183-b4eb-e398da844b37-1
00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:37.600
labels.

78a173ba-8ef5-4032-8c9e-29f92b44126b-0
00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:40.679
All the information that you're
going to need will be below this

78a173ba-8ef5-4032-8c9e-29f92b44126b-1
00:05:40.679 --> 00:05:40.960
video.
