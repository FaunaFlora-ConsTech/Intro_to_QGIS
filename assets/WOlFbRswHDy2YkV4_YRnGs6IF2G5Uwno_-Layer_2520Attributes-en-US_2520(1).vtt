3da6b6c9-731b-40cd-8bcf-5be50436dd4c-0
00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:05.859
Now hopefully you've added these
five data layers into your map

3da6b6c9-731b-40cd-8bcf-5be50436dd4c-1
00:00:05.859 --> 00:00:09.575
frame and you can see them in
your layers window here on the

3da6b6c9-731b-40cd-8bcf-5be50436dd4c-2
00:00:09.575 --> 00:00:09.880
left.

32b5debd-49fb-4392-b541-97eb691a67d1-0
00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.675
First of all, we're going to go
ahead and turn off the ESRI

32b5debd-49fb-4392-b541-97eb691a67d1-1
00:00:13.675 --> 00:00:16.965
standard basemap as we don't
need it anymore and it can slow

32b5debd-49fb-4392-b541-97eb691a67d1-2
00:00:16.965 --> 00:00:17.720
us down a bit.

4cea4b12-67ee-484b-9935-a28a36413f08-0
00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:21.462
And now we'll take a quick look
at all the layers that we've

4cea4b12-67ee-484b-9935-a28a36413f08-1
00:00:21.462 --> 00:00:21.760
added.

f350cf38-ded1-4653-849e-8218dbb77cfa-0
00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.720
So going from the top, we'll
turn off the other layers.

969adb22-8e04-4a58-8d1e-0e52f29adffb-0
00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:30.763
We have our
biomonitoring_Ziama2019 layer

969adb22-8e04-4a58-8d1e-0e52f29adffb-1
00:00:30.763 --> 00:00:36.142
and these are vector point data
and then we'll take a look at

969adb22-8e04-4a58-8d1e-0e52f29adffb-2
00:00:36.142 --> 00:00:41.868
the roads and tracks and so this
is vector line data representing

969adb22-8e04-4a58-8d1e-0e52f29adffb-3
00:00:41.868 --> 00:00:47.160
the roads and tracks in and
around the Ziama protected area.

cc6b63d3-9d5a-47c5-a258-4c494d4603ff-0
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:51.992
The Ziama_Landscape layer is a
polygon representing the

cc6b63d3-9d5a-47c5-a258-4c494d4603ff-1
00:00:51.992 --> 00:00:53.960
protected area of Ziama.

3fc35f6b-eb51-4082-9dd2-19e5480d8cc3-0
00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.360
And then we have the two rasters
at the bottom.

54b7208a-2f91-427b-9bb9-e9fbbfc13416-0
00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.948
So we have a land cover raster
here and we've got the Ziama_DEM

54b7208a-2f91-427b-9bb9-e9fbbfc13416-1
00:01:02.948 --> 00:01:03.560
raster.

be689f80-996b-4945-a694-425927cfd331-0
00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:07.273
And we're going to talk more
about these two raster layers in

be689f80-996b-4945-a694-425927cfd331-1
00:01:07.273 --> 00:01:08.040
another video.

42ced176-48ec-4ae5-a472-99267b632d8d-0
00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.259
In this video we're going to
talk about how to look at the

42ced176-48ec-4ae5-a472-99267b632d8d-1
00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:15.960
attributes of your data.

77781b44-235f-489f-aa6c-7832135e5dc0-0
00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:19.926
So if we take the biomonitoring
points layer to start with, we

77781b44-235f-489f-aa6c-7832135e5dc0-1
00:01:19.926 --> 00:01:23.301
can just see the location of
these points on our map, but we

77781b44-235f-489f-aa6c-7832135e5dc0-2
00:01:23.301 --> 00:01:26.400
don't actually know what these
points are representing.

93b95b9a-1708-45c7-a419-b195a4f0619b-0
00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:30.576
So to look at the data
associated with this layer, we

93b95b9a-1708-45c7-a419-b195a4f0619b-1
00:01:30.576 --> 00:01:35.240
can right click on the layer and
then click Open Attribute Table.

14898b08-ca3d-4bd7-afbe-df3ab4eca951-0
00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:39.040
You can also do the same thing
using one of your toolbars.

584c0e75-d9ef-444f-b8c5-f778c35e596b-0
00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:42.368
If you have the layer selected,
you can go up into your

584c0e75-d9ef-444f-b8c5-f778c35e596b-1
00:01:42.368 --> 00:01:46.172
attributes toolbar, which is up
here, and click on the one that

584c0e75-d9ef-444f-b8c5-f778c35e596b-2
00:01:46.172 --> 00:01:49.857
looks like a table and that's
going to open up your attribute

584c0e75-d9ef-444f-b8c5-f778c35e596b-3
00:01:49.857 --> 00:01:51.759
table for this point data layer.

e4702543-2d47-4cb4-a0ac-798c838896a9-0
00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:59.104
And now in this table we can see
the information attached to each

e4702543-2d47-4cb4-a0ac-798c838896a9-1
00:01:59.104 --> 00:02:00.760
point in this layer.

5f6bc3a6-aa0d-49fc-9714-82554d2e5776-0
00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.877
So we've got columns for date,
latitude, longitude, species and

5f6bc3a6-aa0d-49fc-9714-82554d2e5776-1
00:02:05.877 --> 00:02:06.640
indicator.

0d307bb4-6097-4243-ad0c-d1d1b0464cd5-0
00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.692
And each row in this table is
representing one point that we

0d307bb4-6097-4243-ad0c-d1d1b0464cd5-1
00:02:10.692 --> 00:02:11.880
can see on our map.

c937310f-30bc-4e11-aa95-47fbe2ac7afd-0
00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:17.820
And so now we can see that each
point has a date associated with

c937310f-30bc-4e11-aa95-47fbe2ac7afd-1
00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:22.921
it, a latitude and longitude, a
species that was sighted and the

c937310f-30bc-4e11-aa95-47fbe2ac7afd-2
00:02:22.921 --> 00:02:25.039
indicator of that sighting.

3a0f53b6-3a78-45e1-b26e-8f4dd928d47c-0
00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:31.360
We can use this attribute table
to select the data that we want.

c5ac31fa-cef1-49e3-af57-1c705991c6f0-0
00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:36.181
To do this we just need to click
on the row number and then it's

c5ac31fa-cef1-49e3-af57-1c705991c6f0-1
00:02:36.181 --> 00:02:40.367
going to select that row and we
can see on our map that it's

c5ac31fa-cef1-49e3-af57-1c705991c6f0-2
00:02:40.367 --> 00:02:44.416
highlighted one of the points
that is associated with that

c5ac31fa-cef1-49e3-af57-1c705991c6f0-3
00:02:44.416 --> 00:02:44.760
data.

a3f53f26-fe93-4846-ab50-05e56eaf89d3-0
00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.137
So we can also select multiple
adjacent points just by holding

a3f53f26-fe93-4846-ab50-05e56eaf89d3-1
00:02:49.137 --> 00:02:51.720
down on our mouse and dragging
up and down.

a93b5d64-1800-47f3-bea2-46b3d3f45016-0
00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:57.060
Or to select multiple non
adjacent points we can hold down

a93b5d64-1800-47f3-bea2-46b3d3f45016-1
00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:01.757
the control button on our
computer and then click on the

a93b5d64-1800-47f3-bea2-46b3d3f45016-2
00:03:01.757 --> 00:03:06.123
other rows that we want to
select so you can see the

a93b5d64-1800-47f3-bea2-46b3d3f45016-3
00:03:06.123 --> 00:03:08.760
selected data in the map canvas.

9aee551e-8f80-4b6d-aead-4c73cd256ae9-0
00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:15.398
To clear our selection we need
to go in the top of the

9aee551e-8f80-4b6d-aead-4c73cd256ae9-1
00:03:15.398 --> 00:03:19.087
attribute table and click on
this button here which if you

9aee551e-8f80-4b6d-aead-4c73cd256ae9-2
00:03:19.087 --> 00:03:22.839
hover your mouse over it will
tell you it deselects all the

9aee551e-8f80-4b6d-aead-4c73cd256ae9-3
00:03:22.839 --> 00:03:24.840
selected features in your table.

9ffa8b10-9d7c-4663-965f-0918c13f6edc-0
00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:28.360
So we want to click on that and
then it clears our selection.

7ea7d7d4-fc6d-48cc-9e13-be7f09c5d876-0
00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:32.971
And that's how to look at the
attributes of your data layers

7ea7d7d4-fc6d-48cc-9e13-be7f09c5d876-1
00:03:32.971 --> 00:03:33.800
within QGIS.
