e3306a2f-071a-4121-8e9a-6f80e828817c-0
00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:05.519
OK, so we've changed our
symbology to how we want and our

e3306a2f-071a-4121-8e9a-6f80e828817c-1
00:00:05.519 --> 00:00:07.840
map is starting to come
together.

d2d3b7da-592d-4d96-b6b6-d71608055b54-0
00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:12.000
So in this video we're going to
prepare our map to be exported.

eeb6b199-3c20-413a-ac94-01251b7fc867-0
00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:16.482
So to do that in QGIS we need to
first of all create a print

eeb6b199-3c20-413a-ac94-01251b7fc867-1
00:00:16.482 --> 00:00:16.960
layout.

900aa8f5-fe64-4639-9e62-4202d080c406-0
00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:21.977
So we do this by going into the
project tab at the top, going

900aa8f5-fe64-4639-9e62-4202d080c406-1
00:00:21.977 --> 00:00:26.040
down near the bottom to where it
says New Print Layout.

897e0c22-71ce-4a70-beb5-cd346617548b-0
00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.804
We'll click on this and it's
going to come up this window

897e0c22-71ce-4a70-beb5-cd346617548b-1
00:00:28.804 --> 00:00:30.600
that's prompting us to name our
layout.

aad4cf72-fc83-49c8-95fe-1f77c55f4827-0
00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.440
So let's call it Ziama Landscape
and click OK.

532da337-cb66-45cd-91d0-8fab875c036e-0
00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.513
So that's going to bring up a
new window, our Print Layout

532da337-cb66-45cd-91d0-8fab875c036e-1
00:00:40.513 --> 00:00:42.320
window, which is a blank page.

a3c53161-d6e9-43c4-a8e0-beee2ed43bf4-0
00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:48.311
And so we can access our map
window again just by minimising

a3c53161-d6e9-43c4-a8e0-beee2ed43bf4-1
00:00:48.311 --> 00:00:48.760
this.

57366676-a1ce-4494-8761-38f405e54719-0
00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:50.760
And then we can still access our
map.

ad60383a-3da2-4273-98f1-e28d5dbce01f-0
00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.680
And then we can just go back
into our print layout.

5ef394a5-a662-4be2-824c-bafcdf7dd5b4-0
00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:57.160
So we can work in both of them
just by minimising the windows.

a82ed140-eaa6-48ae-a78e-7d4f8edab82c-0
00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:59.200
And now we're going to add our
map.

46aa7272-49b9-4b9d-bf64-9ec5849e9280-0
00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:03.501
So we'll do that by going into
Add item in the top menu and

46aa7272-49b9-4b9d-bf64-9ec5849e9280-1
00:01:03.501 --> 00:01:04.720
clicking add Map.

09829f7b-5ab1-4883-b36d-8a8025d8c753-0
00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:08.620
And this is going to give us a
tool that's going to let us draw

09829f7b-5ab1-4883-b36d-8a8025d8c753-1
00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:11.000
our map onto our page wherever
we want it.

7cf42341-ca43-40e8-b96e-3582b73ff36a-0
00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:13.600
So draw a square for your map.

88df4ece-02d3-4e2d-942c-de3628cafea0-0
00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.622
And now we can see our map has
come up and our map is a bit

88df4ece-02d3-4e2d-942c-de3628cafea0-1
00:01:18.622 --> 00:01:20.040
smaller than we want it.

080ce328-f57c-42ad-be1c-ee3248128b0f-0
00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.659
So what we need to do is we need
to be able to interact with our

080ce328-f57c-42ad-be1c-ee3248128b0f-1
00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.722
map within this map frame, and
to do that we have to click on

080ce328-f57c-42ad-be1c-ee3248128b0f-2
00:01:28.722 --> 00:01:32.195
the button in the left hand
side, which is move item

080ce328-f57c-42ad-be1c-ee3248128b0f-3
00:01:32.195 --> 00:01:32.720
content.

a6eeb007-4ac1-4f0c-ad48-5fecdd9ea5d8-0
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.480
It's the fourth one down.

5497f75b-d5ec-4675-8405-df83d6f7ff2b-0
00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:38.871
We could also do that by going
into item properties if we have

5497f75b-d5ec-4675-8405-df83d6f7ff2b-1
00:01:38.871 --> 00:01:42.198
our map selected, and there's
also a button in there to do

5497f75b-d5ec-4675-8405-df83d6f7ff2b-2
00:01:42.198 --> 00:01:42.480
that.

7b2b037b-dfb6-421f-a2ac-a462feeca749-0
00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:45.160
But we'll just do it using the
one on the left hand side.

066c84a7-03ec-4a36-ac78-ea772045a6dd-0
00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.914
And now we've clicked that we
can interact with our map, we

066c84a7-03ec-4a36-ac78-ea772045a6dd-1
00:01:48.914 --> 00:01:52.184
can zoom it in to how we want
and we can move it around to how

066c84a7-03ec-4a36-ac78-ea772045a6dd-2
00:01:52.184 --> 00:01:52.600
we want.

9fda060d-2e83-4d59-addb-7de51dd928a5-0
00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:59.090
So get that looking how you want
it to look, and now if you

9fda060d-2e83-4d59-addb-7de51dd928a5-1
00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:05.000
wanted to resize your map frame,
you don't like how it is.

1f1b7db0-5063-4c1c-b5b2-83277f41e137-0
00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.405
You can click on the third
button in the toolbar, so the

1f1b7db0-5063-4c1c-b5b2-83277f41e137-1
00:02:08.405 --> 00:02:12.071
one just above the one that we'd
clicked on, and now you can move

1f1b7db0-5063-4c1c-b5b2-83277f41e137-2
00:02:12.071 --> 00:02:13.960
it and resize it to how you
want.

59c11294-0291-436a-ade2-812ce3bfdb4d-0
00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:18.034
And the top hand button just
lets you move around your layout

59c11294-0291-436a-ade2-812ce3bfdb4d-1
00:02:18.034 --> 00:02:21.436
page without touching or moving
any of the elements on your

59c11294-0291-436a-ade2-812ce3bfdb4d-2
00:02:21.436 --> 00:02:21.720
page.

0bcae89a-cf5f-4f60-b32d-16c382a7a836-0
00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:26.915
And now we'll take a look at the
layout of this print layout

0bcae89a-cf5f-4f60-b32d-16c382a7a836-1
00:02:26.915 --> 00:02:27.240
view.

69b3680b-5178-4853-8cb3-9d3ad76fb4d1-0
00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:31.590
So it's quite similar to the map
view that we had when we're

69b3680b-5178-4853-8cb3-9d3ad76fb4d1-1
00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:32.960
working within our map.

bc5123b0-7797-4f5c-938b-83c545138cd8-0
00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.393
We've got the same sort of
layout with toolbars across the

bc5123b0-7797-4f5c-938b-83c545138cd8-1
00:02:37.393 --> 00:02:41.507
top and a menu bar across the
very top and so we'll have a

bc5123b0-7797-4f5c-938b-83c545138cd8-2
00:02:41.507 --> 00:02:46.040
look at the different tabs that
we have within the menu bar now.

21ee5be0-f98c-4e1e-9460-d770eb04fcd4-0
00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:50.874
So the first one is layout and
this is similar to project

21ee5be0-f98c-4e1e-9460-d770eb04fcd4-1
00:02:50.874 --> 00:02:52.280
within the map view.

e66463ca-f347-43f3-bfa8-c180e89368a2-0
00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.760
So this is where we could save
our project.

ad5a0778-3879-494b-b425-0f63d226224c-0
00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:59.651
We can create a new layout and
within this section we can

ad5a0778-3879-494b-b425-0f63d226224c-1
00:02:59.651 --> 00:03:01.480
export our map as well.

6dc371c9-5ad6-44b7-8018-688e7b7eeee8-0
00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:06.760
And then looking at the edit
tab.

1c112b84-cf24-4f9a-bc5e-52039abedc50-0
00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:14.398
In here we have undo and redo
buttons as well as copy and

1c112b84-cf24-4f9a-bc5e-52039abedc50-1
00:03:14.398 --> 00:03:21.969
paste functions, and we also
have options for selecting and

1c112b84-cf24-4f9a-bc5e-52039abedc50-2
00:03:21.969 --> 00:03:26.260
moving around our layout in
view.

8a5a5d18-1d27-47dc-acd9-d44199abcc67-0
00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:32.791
We have options for zooming and
we can also set a grid or guides

8a5a5d18-1d27-47dc-acd9-d44199abcc67-1
00:03:32.791 --> 00:03:38.620
in here and these help us align
our map and map elements.

e211f0ed-f6fa-4e8e-a9a8-cc6dfbf17a1b-0
00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:43.996
We have rulers and guides
toggled on and so this is why we

e211f0ed-f6fa-4e8e-a9a8-cc6dfbf17a1b-1
00:03:43.996 --> 00:03:49.170
can see the measurements around
the sides of our page around the

e211f0ed-f6fa-4e8e-a9a8-cc6dfbf17a1b-2
00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:51.240
top on the left hand side.

8b107a82-74a9-45ab-af9d-4d61cf5c0375-0
00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:56.528
These are our rulers and the
guides will pop up when we move

8b107a82-74a9-45ab-af9d-4d61cf5c0375-1
00:03:56.528 --> 00:04:01.200
items around and these help us
align our items in view.

a4031e1c-69ec-4f22-b9e0-743714d1ad54-0
00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:11.770
We can also toggle our toolbars
and panels on and off.

e06ff7f6-e6a9-4d81-9714-fe97e31a4b4e-0
00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:15.493
In items we can group the things
that we add onto our layout

e06ff7f6-e6a9-4d81-9714-fe97e31a4b4e-1
00:04:15.493 --> 00:04:18.553
together and we can also
organise them to bring them to

e06ff7f6-e6a9-4d81-9714-fe97e31a4b4e-2
00:04:18.553 --> 00:04:19.920
the front or to the back.

d5dc9cec-11cb-43ea-af61-bd89201e8b3e-0
00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:25.092
And in here we can also lock
items, align them and resize

d5dc9cec-11cb-43ea-af61-bd89201e8b3e-1
00:04:25.092 --> 00:04:25.480
them.

0f1a645d-8dc4-4c4b-9b31-48d392392db6-0
00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:31.778
Add item is a really useful
section so this is where we can

0f1a645d-8dc4-4c4b-9b31-48d392392db6-1
00:04:31.778 --> 00:04:35.100
add in a lot of the elements
into our print layout that we

0f1a645d-8dc4-4c4b-9b31-48d392392db6-2
00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:35.719
might want.

4529c12b-f673-49d4-97f9-9bf039ecd15b-0
00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:39.040
So this is where we went to add
in our map frame.

81de0b33-8158-4b37-b8ef-2607e8e0a262-0
00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:44.375
There's also options for adding
pictures and labels and legends,

81de0b33-8158-4b37-b8ef-2607e8e0a262-1
00:04:44.375 --> 00:04:45.720
shapes and arrows.

d1fa0721-1706-4816-b01d-ba60090f7f97-0
00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:48.040
We're going to take a look at
adding a scale bar.

971f7da6-5748-419f-ba33-3607a62ac918-0
00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:52.813
So we're going to click where it
says add scale bar and this is

971f7da6-5748-419f-ba33-3607a62ac918-1
00:04:52.813 --> 00:04:57.661
going to give us the draw mouse
again so we can draw it onto our

971f7da6-5748-419f-ba33-3607a62ac918-2
00:04:57.661 --> 00:04:57.960
map.

233caee0-0e49-4773-8cd2-21e17c0c3932-0
00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:04.560
And there's our scale bar.

5e5c0075-4ace-4c73-b491-64c8a9079f01-0
00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:09.139
So if we wanted to change this
further to suit our preferences,

5e5c0075-4ace-4c73-b491-64c8a9079f01-1
00:05:09.139 --> 00:05:13.575
we can just either click on it
within our map frame or within

5e5c0075-4ace-4c73-b491-64c8a9079f01-2
00:05:13.575 --> 00:05:14.719
the items panel.

e1d110a6-9ed2-4dc0-807d-bac88df83fcd-0
00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:17.920
Here on the right hand side we
make sure it's selected.

e101533e-b1ce-4bfd-8433-fe9dd23fce7b-0
00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:24.080
Then we can go into item
properties which is just below.

455b0422-e5dd-4a8c-8ebe-9d06f61a1767-0
00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:29.911
And this is where we have all
the options for changing how our

455b0422-e5dd-4a8c-8ebe-9d06f61a1767-1
00:05:29.911 --> 00:05:33.440
scale bar looks and like the
scale bar units.

47f2087a-88fc-4472-adb5-0e66e74a4bbb-0
00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:37.000
For example position and size.

902dd584-561e-46ad-8822-87ed2bb8575e-0
00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.932
So this is where we have all of
the different options for

902dd584-561e-46ad-8822-87ed2bb8575e-1
00:05:40.932 --> 00:05:42.560
setting our preferences.

ba148458-9da4-49f2-92eb-81495c47645f-0
00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.240
Let's also take a look at adding
a north arrow.

6e542816-814e-4f57-bc9a-22989a508c5b-0
00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:53.894
So we'll do that by going back
into add item and go on add

6e542816-814e-4f57-bc9a-22989a508c5b-1
00:05:53.894 --> 00:05:54.760
north arrow.

f18456f0-430e-4774-b770-fc0b53032766-0
00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:59.745
So adding a N arrow isn't
normally necessary unless your

f18456f0-430e-4774-b770-fc0b53032766-1
00:05:59.745 --> 00:06:03.770
map isn't orientated north, but
we'll do it anyway just to have

f18456f0-430e-4774-b770-fc0b53032766-2
00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:05.279
a look at how you do it.

d479795e-e3f5-4c83-b26f-aa68c89adf09-0
00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:09.967
And now you can see that we have
these guidelines popping up to

d479795e-e3f5-4c83-b26f-aa68c89adf09-1
00:06:09.967 --> 00:06:11.760
help us align our elements.

b370d3d7-080f-4cc6-8a7f-1483e03a6752-0
00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:18.135
So let's draw our north arrow on
and now we can resize this and

b370d3d7-080f-4cc6-8a7f-1483e03a6752-1
00:06:18.135 --> 00:06:21.920
move it around to how we want it
to be.

0f28c1ae-56e1-4750-a373-b714eac70abf-0
00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:29.920
And again to change the north
arrow.

7bb738f1-e77a-4dae-b3bc-77e37d984b83-0
00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:34.382
To get it exactly how we want
it, we can click on it in our

7bb738f1-e77a-4dae-b3bc-77e37d984b83-1
00:06:34.382 --> 00:06:38.994
map frame or within the items,
and now we can access the item

7bb738f1-e77a-4dae-b3bc-77e37d984b83-2
00:06:38.994 --> 00:06:43.160
properties and we can change it
to exactly how we want.

d6f2295f-c847-416b-bef0-5cdd0b24acdb-0
00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:52.654
Let's take a look at the other
tabs that we've not gone through

d6f2295f-c847-416b-bef0-5cdd0b24acdb-1
00:06:52.654 --> 00:06:52.850
yet.

bf240857-e4bb-4b2b-98f8-c340086a615c-0
00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:55.290
So we have the Atlas tab.

acdd51bc-4f49-4d4c-87f2-f4cef6d04e27-0
00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:57.600
We're not going to worry too
much about this.

7cb5d785-9b20-4537-9e5d-c1587bebc103-0
00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:01.256
We would use this if we wanted
to make a map template to

7cb5d785-9b20-4537-9e5d-c1587bebc103-1
00:07:01.256 --> 00:07:04.396
publish a large number of
similar maps for different

7cb5d785-9b20-4537-9e5d-c1587bebc103-2
00:07:04.396 --> 00:07:05.640
geographic locations.

c6506c28-f04b-463d-9ae7-00e3bbc8fac5-0
00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:11.200
In settings we can access our
layout options.

4b612158-12b0-46bb-ad6e-fc5cbc647128-0
00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:15.034
So this is where we set our
preferences for how we want our

4b612158-12b0-46bb-ad6e-fc5cbc647128-1
00:07:15.034 --> 00:07:17.080
layout page to function or look.

6ae253e5-f969-47f7-b1d5-f6556b3b5668-0
00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:23.200
And then again underneath this
menu bar we have our toolbars.

09c89bc9-ea42-4a78-832c-0ace537a5828-0
00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:28.598
So we've got some quick access
buttons that we can use within

09c89bc9-ea42-4a78-832c-0ace537a5828-1
00:07:28.598 --> 00:07:33.735
here and if we right click we
can also access where we can

09c89bc9-ea42-4a78-832c-0ace537a5828-2
00:07:33.735 --> 00:07:37.480
toggle the panels and toolbars
on and off.

92b0d940-89e9-47ef-b1d5-04fe3e449c0f-0
00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:43.080
In the left hand side we've got
these quick buttons as well.

62ecce83-4899-47a4-b6ef-416b3703b2d2-0
00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:47.781
So this is some of the ones that
we've been using like to be able

62ecce83-4899-47a4-b6ef-416b3703b2d2-1
00:07:47.781 --> 00:07:52.412
to interact with our map or move
around our layout or select our

62ecce83-4899-47a4-b6ef-416b3703b2d2-2
00:07:52.412 --> 00:07:52.840
items.

dada97d3-93eb-4afa-a2b8-640f6e7a07ad-0
00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.560
So there's some really useful
quick access buttons here.

093b5de6-b591-4715-9724-ca81fd08293f-0
00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:01.560
Let's take a look on the right
hand side.

8adbf598-8feb-4a3e-b8ad-e44abcb85aa1-0
00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:03.960
So in here we have our items.

519d8a88-ff11-487a-bfcd-1599729bc853-0
00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:07.320
This is where we've been
selecting our items.

beb00591-1f84-48a2-b311-011e74b0b360-0
00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:11.202
We also have toggle boxes for
each item so we can turn them on

beb00591-1f84-48a2-b311-011e74b0b360-1
00:08:11.202 --> 00:08:11.640
and off.

5cbd4241-0d48-4dde-9f39-943c1ccbcb6c-0
00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:18.114
And we have boxes to lock the
items as well to lock them into

5cbd4241-0d48-4dde-9f39-943c1ccbcb6c-1
00:08:18.114 --> 00:08:18.640
place.

712cdac2-5b48-416b-b0d4-1d3d1671ae8d-0
00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:20.200
And now we can't move it.

3b43b98a-d5fa-47b5-8081-40a9cee95cce-0
00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:27.480
And we can also drag them up and
down in here.

2c288938-c2ab-4e19-8add-e3c2bf14b2bd-0
00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:30.822
And so we could put elements on
top of each other, like we've

2c288938-c2ab-4e19-8add-e3c2bf14b2bd-1
00:08:30.822 --> 00:08:32.440
just moved the map to the top.

93ba06f9-8f3b-4150-9d23-949ae2161c89-0
00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:39.120
The tab just next to items is
undo history.

f8cf1082-c673-4a71-a18b-6a838a45c318-0
00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:42.690
And this is where we can see the
history of all the things that

f8cf1082-c673-4a71-a18b-6a838a45c318-1
00:08:42.690 --> 00:08:44.200
we've done within our layout.

eb8466be-0a21-4f1f-a697-84f8f8d52ea1-0
00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:48.072
And we can click on one of them
to go back to what we had done

eb8466be-0a21-4f1f-a697-84f8f8d52ea1-1
00:08:48.072 --> 00:08:48.480
before.

a598177c-a55d-4b46-a667-39fd0ae53476-0
00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:55.360
And now we'll take a look at the
window underneath our items.

5092391a-1364-47f6-a3f8-c7df333d7ba3-0
00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:58.223
And so we have our item
properties that we've been

5092391a-1364-47f6-a3f8-c7df333d7ba3-1
00:08:58.223 --> 00:08:58.560
using.

e87d3394-937a-4fe7-a026-c83b8bf0a46f-0
00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:00.840
But let's take a look at the
layout.

da55a795-1fe5-41a5-9e75-b5c2e981790b-0
00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:04.160
So layout.

bce62445-08f8-4804-8e7f-5c8dbde6b381-0
00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:09.715
We just have some preferences
for the actual layout of our

bce62445-08f8-4804-8e7f-5c8dbde6b381-1
00:09:09.715 --> 00:09:15.836
page, so things like our guides
and grids, export functions, and

bce62445-08f8-4804-8e7f-5c8dbde6b381-2
00:09:15.836 --> 00:09:17.719
resizing our layout.

0104e10c-363d-4c81-b117-7ac274d09d0a-0
00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:24.384
So we've already taken a look at
the Item properties tab, but

0104e10c-363d-4c81-b117-7ac274d09d0a-1
00:09:24.384 --> 00:09:27.400
we'll just take a look at our
map properties.

392d7cd2-ee2f-4583-8d62-6c0b7e5ac887-0
00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:31.280
So we'll make sure our map is
selected in our items.

fb0216a8-5d14-45a7-a2fa-d280943c8674-0
00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:38.880
And now let's look at the map
item properties.

0ba8463d-af49-43ee-812f-f0a944c7ae92-0
00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:43.907
So what we can have access to
now is the buttons that are at

0ba8463d-af49-43ee-812f-f0a944c7ae92-1
00:09:43.907 --> 00:09:44.520
the top.

09130445-7e7f-492d-9ca8-7c176ee05e87-0
00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:49.600
And so we have some buttons for
changing the extent of our map.

bb8581fa-3e9b-47f8-84c3-970721fc103d-0
00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.920
We also have a button to access
the bookmarks within our map.

d4d6a046-db9f-441b-b398-7ca5a4ce2c55-0
00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:57.705
So for example, the Italy
bookmark that we created, we can

d4d6a046-db9f-441b-b398-7ca5a4ce2c55-1
00:09:57.705 --> 00:10:01.427
now go and access that and we
have the button as well for

d4d6a046-db9f-441b-b398-7ca5a4ce2c55-2
00:10:01.427 --> 00:10:05.276
being able to interact within
our map, so to move it around

d4d6a046-db9f-441b-b398-7ca5a4ce2c55-3
00:10:05.276 --> 00:10:06.560
and zoom in and out.

7ae20b17-809d-43db-b1d2-a2ce09734eb4-0
00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:14.826
And then within item properties,
we can change the scale of our

7ae20b17-809d-43db-b1d2-a2ce09734eb4-1
00:10:14.826 --> 00:10:21.441
map, the rotation we could
manually change the extent of

7ae20b17-809d-43db-b1d2-a2ce09734eb4-2
00:10:21.441 --> 00:10:28.520
our map and scrolling down,
we've got lots of other options.

67f946a0-0fd8-49ef-bfee-58a64dc7bb74-0
00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:34.090
So you can just play around and
change your map to exactly how

67f946a0-0fd8-49ef-bfee-58a64dc7bb74-1
00:10:34.090 --> 00:10:34.880
you want.

713981b2-9f2e-4aa9-a298-259e6b93ae53-0
00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:37.960
We're going to take a look at
adding grid lines.

6eea6e46-71f3-4982-899b-4f22985cadad-0
00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:43.142
So to do that we need to click
on this green plus symbol here

6eea6e46-71f3-4982-899b-4f22985cadad-1
00:10:43.142 --> 00:10:47.888
underneath where it says grids
and we can select the grid we

6eea6e46-71f3-4982-899b-4f22985cadad-2
00:10:47.888 --> 00:10:52.866
added and click modify grid and
now this is going to let us add

6eea6e46-71f3-4982-899b-4f22985cadad-3
00:10:52.866 --> 00:10:53.800
our grid in.

38ba38aa-f6e4-427e-9b9b-b12ead951eac-0
00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:56.694
So at the moment we can't see
our grid even though we added it

38ba38aa-f6e4-427e-9b9b-b12ead951eac-1
00:10:56.694 --> 00:10:58.440
because we need to set the
intervals.

05521524-82f2-434f-b0ab-ee1af5d1449d-0
00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:03.320
First of all for grid type we
want it to be solid.

a2b89456-80e4-489e-bdb6-27e7c65f84f9-0
00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:08.818
This is going to make some solid
lines over our map, and then for

a2b89456-80e4-489e-bdb6-27e7c65f84f9-1
00:11:08.818 --> 00:11:11.800
interval we'll set this as map
units.

b0a6cdc4-7ff9-4348-8575-50b3e538ff79-0
00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:15.480
So which unit this is depends on
the projected coordinate system

b0a6cdc4-7ff9-4348-8575-50b3e538ff79-1
00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:16.160
of your map.

696951a7-1332-4287-81a6-7d11e95a1619-0
00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:20.465
If your map coordinate system is
in degrees, you'll want

696951a7-1332-4287-81a6-7d11e95a1619-1
00:11:20.465 --> 00:11:24.280
something like 0.00001 intervals
in this X&amp;Y box.

c7306ed8-07f9-4004-95bd-5f9f3363e881-0
00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:28.069
But our map coordinate system is
in metres, so something around

c7306ed8-07f9-4004-95bd-5f9f3363e881-1
00:11:28.069 --> 00:11:29.400
10,000 should work well.

292dda52-20fe-43b8-98ed-dc7d463793be-0
00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:32.480
So let's put that in the X&amp;Y
box.

e7db7564-72f2-4367-8020-01c5221903ca-0
00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:42.960
And now we have our grid lines,
but we want to add some labels.

079b95ab-d876-4df7-890f-003ccd545123-0
00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:46.040
So we're going to add some ticks
and labels.

f4553650-9310-4940-b9df-4505265492ee-0
00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:52.129
To add our ticks we can scroll
down and go into the frame

f4553650-9310-4940-b9df-4505265492ee-1
00:11:52.129 --> 00:11:57.760
section and under frame style we
can put exterior ticks.

a75f4e51-e5c4-46d0-885b-4c1396b708b7-0
00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:03.488
And this just added the little
tick marks around the outside of

a75f4e51-e5c4-46d0-885b-4c1396b708b7-1
00:12:03.488 --> 00:12:04.000
our map.

71a5151e-6233-43b0-8b58-960cb39eb25a-0
00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:07.680
And now let's add our labels.

e3f37f64-a859-4942-8ad2-e93a3339e32d-0
00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:10.519
So to do that we'll Scroll down
to where it says draw

e3f37f64-a859-4942-8ad2-e93a3339e32d-1
00:12:10.519 --> 00:12:12.360
coordinates and toggle the box
on.

d7b644e7-7385-430b-947a-e58c99c77b8e-0
00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:18.256
And now we've got some labels,
so let's change the format

d7b644e7-7385-430b-947a-e58c99c77b8e-1
00:12:18.256 --> 00:12:23.154
because we want decimal with
suffix and that's going to give

d7b644e7-7385-430b-947a-e58c99c77b8e-2
00:12:23.154 --> 00:12:24.840
us the north and West

9a0442ee-bdac-4090-b402-86ea03803866-0
00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:29.794
so we know that we're looking at
the longitude and the latitude,

9a0442ee-bdac-4090-b402-86ea03803866-1
00:12:29.794 --> 00:12:34.520
and we can set lots of different
preferences in this section.

581599ff-c350-45ee-88b9-3a6a8b0d5329-0
00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:38.311
So have a play around with these
different buttons to get your

00:12:38.311 --> 00:12:40.960
grid lines and your labels to
how you want.

00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:45.149
We're just going to change the
coordinate position for for now,

ccfa9e5d-9300-4598-8351-b9fa5188b278-1
00:12:45.149 --> 00:12:48.277
so we're just going to put zero
here just to get rid of those

ccfa9e5d-9300-4598-8351-b9fa5188b278-2
00:12:48.277 --> 00:12:49.639
unnecessary decimal points.

00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:55.034
So that's how to add grids, and
that's all the main buttons and

00:12:55.034 --> 00:12:57.560
layouts of the print layout
window in QGIS.

00:12:57.960 --> 00:13:00.660
The last thing we're going to
talk about is how to get your

b346698f-411f-4782-b1b5-33206d4629b9-1
00:13:00.660 --> 00:13:02.640
layout back up if you
accidentally shut it.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:08.338
So if you accidentally hit the X
button and you needed to get it

9ec74ac3-35dd-4976-b6d4-71e8373233ab-1
00:13:08.338 --> 00:13:13.513
back up, go in your map view in
your project and you can go in

9ec74ac3-35dd-4976-b6d4-71e8373233ab-2
00:13:13.513 --> 00:13:18.441
the Project tab, go into the
layouts and now you can access

9ec74ac3-35dd-4976-b6d4-71e8373233ab-3
00:13:18.441 --> 00:13:19.920
your layout again.
