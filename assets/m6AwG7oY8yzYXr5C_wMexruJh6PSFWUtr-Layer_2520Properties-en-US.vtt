9f07af59-8520-4784-a03c-6c0a064da887-0
00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:05.344
Now that we've taken a look at
how to open up our data layer

9f07af59-8520-4784-a03c-6c0a064da887-1
00:00:05.344 --> 00:00:09.434
attribute table, we're going to
take a look at our data layer

9f07af59-8520-4784-a03c-6c0a064da887-2
00:00:09.434 --> 00:00:10.160
properties.

2eebbce2-e8ee-40d4-9ef4-283770375945-0
00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:14.886
So to do this, we're going to
look at the biomonitoring Ziama

2eebbce2-e8ee-40d4-9ef4-283770375945-1
00:00:14.886 --> 00:00:15.640
2019 layer.

8959bc5e-608b-46c8-9424-7fa39584a090-0
00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:19.765
We'll select this, right click,
and then on the menu that pops

8959bc5e-608b-46c8-9424-7fa39584a090-1
00:00:19.765 --> 00:00:23.040
up we can go to the bottom and
choose properties.

f2153a62-566e-44ac-b58e-023df9f179ed-0
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.304
And this is going to bring up
this layer properties window,

f2153a62-566e-44ac-b58e-023df9f179ed-1
00:00:28.304 --> 00:00:31.720
which has all the properties
associated with this data layer.

bf2f94f7-f5de-4de5-a09b-7b6c6b23c956-0
00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:34.960
So we have lots of different
tabs here that we can look at.

fc713876-0a97-4356-b240-beea8a585418-0
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.134
We're in information right now,
which is just giving us a bit of

fc713876-0a97-4356-b240-beea8a585418-1
00:00:39.134 --> 00:00:43.268
information about the layer like
where it's come from, but we're

fc713876-0a97-4356-b240-beea8a585418-2
00:00:43.268 --> 00:00:45.240
going to take a look at source.

2b6ba278-48bb-4749-b96b-01ab82bf0e07-0
00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.200
So in source you can change the
name of your data layer.

5d0a1c0f-c584-44c7-b819-d1820fd436f1-0
00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.651
It's good practice to change the
names of your data layers so

5d0a1c0f-c584-44c7-b819-d1820fd436f1-1
00:00:53.651 --> 00:00:56.760
that they're easy to read and to
know what you're working with.

accba8c6-70c5-4f51-978e-654d6a343c66-0
00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:00.846
So let's change this just
biomonitoring points so it's

accba8c6-70c5-4f51-978e-654d6a343c66-1
00:01:00.846 --> 00:01:02.400
nice and clear what it is.

e563dbae-fb76-4600-a65a-4980f48ddd75-0
00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:11.958
Another thing we can look at in
our layer properties is what

e563dbae-fb76-4600-a65a-4980f48ddd75-1
00:01:11.958 --> 00:01:15.870
coordinate system our data layer
was collected or created in.

224f1704-8d71-4cfe-bf3f-9ec05654152c-0
00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.538
We can look at this just
underneath where it says

224f1704-8d71-4cfe-bf3f-9ec05654152c-1
00:01:19.538 --> 00:01:21.870
assigned coordinate reference
system.

5791b8e3-a2ff-4936-88a3-d4376f08dd1d-0
00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.309
So in the box underneath this,
it tells us that our data layer

5791b8e3-a2ff-4936-88a3-d4376f08dd1d-1
00:01:27.309 --> 00:01:30.160
is in the coordinate system WGS
84.

dd0f421d-b68f-4ee8-870a-84b840bfe584-0
00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.485
If we want to find out a little
bit more about this, we can

dd0f421d-b68f-4ee8-870a-84b840bfe584-1
00:01:34.485 --> 00:01:38.070
hover our mouse over this box
and it brings up this window

dd0f421d-b68f-4ee8-870a-84b840bfe584-2
00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.986
which tells us the exact
information about this

dd0f421d-b68f-4ee8-870a-84b840bfe584-3
00:01:40.986 --> 00:01:42.079
coordinate system.

6ec5951c-705c-4ecf-8ec6-9b6d97fa1fa6-0
00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:47.151
So if we look at the the first
line within this window that's

6ec5951c-705c-4ecf-8ec6-9b6d97fa1fa6-1
00:01:47.151 --> 00:01:50.280
come up, we can see that it says
GEOG CRS.

b3739313-76d4-4e42-9396-6860d8f2527f-0
00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.773
So this is standing for
Geographic Coordinate system or

b3739313-76d4-4e42-9396-6860d8f2527f-1
00:01:53.773 --> 00:01:55.520
Coordinate Reference system.

45f5a92f-ccbb-4510-94f5-cdffaac3548e-0
00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:00.822
So it's telling us that this
data layer is in a GCS and it's

45f5a92f-ccbb-4510-94f5-cdffaac3548e-1
00:02:00.822 --> 00:02:04.280
also giving us the name again,
so WGS 84.

11636f83-bb89-42a8-bb2d-fb0c06b01d1d-0
00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:10.672
So the last thing we're going to
look at in properties now is the

11636f83-bb89-42a8-bb2d-fb0c06b01d1d-1
00:02:10.672 --> 00:02:11.200
metadata.

1eb9d217-6dd3-4f74-a0e9-ad8df9fd690b-0
00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:16.844
So we're going to do this by
clicking on the Metadata tab,

1eb9d217-6dd3-4f74-a0e9-ad8df9fd690b-1
00:02:16.844 --> 00:02:22.529
and we can see that within this
Metadata tab we've got lots of

1eb9d217-6dd3-4f74-a0e9-ad8df9fd690b-2
00:02:22.529 --> 00:02:26.320
different options for adding in
metadata.

18c2664f-c0ff-48e8-8850-e81cbc8cae49-0
00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:31.558
But you can also see that this
data layer doesn't have any

18c2664f-c0ff-48e8-8850-e81cbc8cae49-1
00:02:31.558 --> 00:02:32.440
metadata yet.

71196917-ea31-470c-aec2-6e932581925b-0
00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.855
Metadata is really useful when
you're sharing data layers, as

71196917-ea31-470c-aec2-6e932581925b-1
00:02:36.855 --> 00:02:40.200
it helps the user to understand
what the data is showing.

ce9d54af-a28e-40e2-b3a2-f0c106d1c4d2-0
00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:44.520
So let's add some metadata to
our biomonitoring points.

277c841c-3e7e-4ac1-adb7-a7574536cc7d-0
00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:51.040
So first of all, in title we can
put biomonitoring points.

9820c346-8611-4ed5-8444-32afa2e3fe92-0
00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:02.113
And the other thing we'll add is
a description of our data layer

9820c346-8611-4ed5-8444-32afa2e3fe92-1
00:03:02.113 --> 00:03:03.450
within the abstract.

b4f6b962-a7f7-45b5-8512-fc1d68f9b744-0
00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:09.850
So in here we're going to put
locations of biomonitoring

b4f6b962-a7f7-45b5-8512-fc1d68f9b744-1
00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:15.638
points of species within and
nearby the Ziama protected area,

b4f6b962-a7f7-45b5-8512-fc1d68f9b744-2
00:03:15.638 --> 00:03:21.706
and these points were collected
from the 14th of the 1st 2019 to

b4f6b962-a7f7-45b5-8512-fc1d68f9b744-3
00:03:21.706 --> 00:03:24.040
the 23rd of the 1st 2020.

ccb32c22-a738-4ff9-8a6a-035b6b9aea80-0
00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:27.921
And we'll also tell them that
the XY coordinates of the

ccb32c22-a738-4ff9-8a6a-035b6b9aea80-1
00:03:27.921 --> 00:03:31.266
locations are given, as well as
the species and the type of

ccb32c22-a738-4ff9-8a6a-035b6b9aea80-2
00:03:31.266 --> 00:03:31.880
indication.

0da5a033-053e-4c7d-b185-5135d11fe31e-0
00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:37.580
So now if we were to send this
data layer to someone and they

0da5a033-053e-4c7d-b185-5135d11fe31e-1
00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:40.958
weren't sure what this data
layer is representing, what

0da5a033-053e-4c7d-b185-5135d11fe31e-2
00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:44.939
these points represent, they can
check this metadata and they can

0da5a033-053e-4c7d-b185-5135d11fe31e-3
00:03:44.939 --> 00:03:48.197
get this information and
understand what this data is

0da5a033-053e-4c7d-b185-5135d11fe31e-4
00:03:48.197 --> 00:03:48.680
showing.

ada12f8b-367b-4640-821e-1c14b68643b6-0
00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:54.372
And so we'll just click the
apply to make sure we save our

ada12f8b-367b-4640-821e-1c14b68643b6-1
00:03:54.372 --> 00:03:54.960
changes.

211cbbda-720e-4d33-97bd-7a153803c745-0
00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:58.840
And that's it.

7fd7e66f-ce36-49c0-891d-e4437e047845-0
00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:02.280
That's how to look at the
properties of your data layers.
