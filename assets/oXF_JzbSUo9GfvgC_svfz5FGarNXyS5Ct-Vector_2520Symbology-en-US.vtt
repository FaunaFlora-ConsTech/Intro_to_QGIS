6781ffdc-32ba-4f14-a8c1-e41294cd896f-0
00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:05.377
Now we have taken a look at our
data layer attributes and

6781ffdc-32ba-4f14-a8c1-e41294cd896f-1
00:00:05.377 --> 00:00:09.097
properties and hopefully you
have changed the names of all

6781ffdc-32ba-4f14-a8c1-e41294cd896f-2
00:00:09.097 --> 00:00:12.440
your layers so they're nice and
clear what they are.

8f640d98-3d55-4807-aaea-713b48dd4047-0
00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:16.327
We're going to learn how to
change the symbology of our

8f640d98-3d55-4807-aaea-713b48dd4047-1
00:00:16.327 --> 00:00:20.385
vector data layers in this video
so we can turn off any of the

8f640d98-3d55-4807-aaea-713b48dd4047-2
00:00:20.385 --> 00:00:23.800
raster layers that we have on
the two raster layers.

7a8cf2f2-8618-4c9d-8096-9565ae9793d0-0
00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:27.061
We can turn them off because we
won't need them in this

7a8cf2f2-8618-4c9d-8096-9565ae9793d0-1
00:00:27.061 --> 00:00:30.672
tutorial, and we'll just take a
look at our three vector data

7a8cf2f2-8618-4c9d-8096-9565ae9793d0-2
00:00:30.672 --> 00:00:31.080
layers.

27a5f704-a868-43fa-8641-f3d875dbf999-0
00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:34.743
So we've got the biomonitoring
points, the roads and the

27a5f704-a868-43fa-8641-f3d875dbf999-1
00:00:34.743 --> 00:00:37.600
polygon representing the Ziama
protected area.

7145c2b0-a244-41a8-b0f1-d08498362d8e-0
00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:41.100
We're going to look at the
symbology of the Ziama protected

7145c2b0-a244-41a8-b0f1-d08498362d8e-1
00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.120
area in this video.

18c51064-6853-412c-82d1-92e3cc4c6e2c-0
00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:47.550
So at the moment you can see
we've got a pink Polygon with a

18c51064-6853-412c-82d1-92e3cc4c6e2c-1
00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.600
thin black outline representing
our protected area.

f9ec5c7d-88b6-4483-95f7-6c82650c9bb8-0
00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:53.320
But we're going to change this.

d185fca6-ec28-4fcf-b8c5-f32bd354c3be-0
00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.543
So to change the symbology we
need to go back into our layer

d185fca6-ec28-4fcf-b8c5-f32bd354c3be-1
00:00:57.543 --> 00:00:59.000
properties window again.

91da62b4-83f5-45f8-98a4-2aa68593e784-0
00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.600
So hopefully you can remember
how to do that.

71d3457c-2200-420b-8bf2-657361d2bff4-0
00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.626
We can right click on our layer,
so we're going to right click on

71d3457c-2200-420b-8bf2-657361d2bff4-1
00:01:05.626 --> 00:01:08.920
the Ziama PA layer and now we
can go into properties.

f85726c4-9272-471f-9fcf-167465b358ba-0
00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:12.676
You can also do this though just
by double clicking on your data

f85726c4-9272-471f-9fcf-167465b358ba-1
00:01:12.676 --> 00:01:15.760
layer and then it brings up the
layer properties window.

8db4d73c-9870-4766-ad06-81f954a6213b-0
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.384
So now we're in properties, we
can go into this symbology tab

8db4d73c-9870-4766-ad06-81f954a6213b-1
00:01:23.384 --> 00:01:27.697
and so first of all within this
symbology tab we're going to

8db4d73c-9870-4766-ad06-81f954a6213b-2
00:01:27.697 --> 00:01:30.880
take a look at the drop down box
at the top.

69f8c3c4-e09e-45ab-81c7-ee4361c5b7cd-0
00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:36.278
So this is allowing us to choose
from a selection of symbology

69f8c3c4-e09e-45ab-81c7-ee4361c5b7cd-1
00:01:36.278 --> 00:01:36.720
types.

f50e3aaa-05fe-417d-a110-6425ebe1026d-0
00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:40.683
We have it as a single symbol at
the moment which is the best way

f50e3aaa-05fe-417d-a110-6425ebe1026d-1
00:01:40.683 --> 00:01:44.068
to represent our single Polygon,
but sometimes you'll need to

f50e3aaa-05fe-417d-a110-6425ebe1026d-2
00:01:44.068 --> 00:01:47.290
change this option depending on
the data layer that you're

f50e3aaa-05fe-417d-a110-6425ebe1026d-3
00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:48.000
working with.

1d13af58-97b0-43f6-b2db-8193e7881e6f-0
00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:54.763
Underneath this drop down box we
have our symbol here so this is

1d13af58-97b0-43f6-b2db-8193e7881e6f-1
00:01:54.763 --> 00:01:56.560
going to give us a preview.

df302316-ceef-4a86-adea-86482c8f6847-0
00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.466
If we change any of the
symbology settings in here it's

df302316-ceef-4a86-adea-86482c8f6847-1
00:01:59.466 --> 00:02:02.683
going to give us a preview of
how it's going to look and then

df302316-ceef-4a86-adea-86482c8f6847-2
00:02:02.683 --> 00:02:05.901
if we're happy with it, we can
click apply and it will change

df302316-ceef-4a86-adea-86482c8f6847-3
00:02:05.901 --> 00:02:08.600
the symbology that we have on
our actual map frame.

76850fa6-a7b4-4a8c-aec8-ddfea15ce49b-0
00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:15.821
Underneath we have the option
for unit, so the size unit of

76850fa6-a7b4-4a8c-aec8-ddfea15ce49b-1
00:02:15.821 --> 00:02:21.472
our symbol that we can change if
we want and in opacity we can

76850fa6-a7b4-4a8c-aec8-ddfea15ce49b-2
00:02:21.472 --> 00:02:25.240
change the how transparent our
symbol is.

53026261-9b36-4a2e-9ea2-40e63d1d2592-0
00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.761
So you can see that the preview
at the the symbol preview is

53026261-9b36-4a2e-9ea2-40e63d1d2592-1
00:02:29.761 --> 00:02:33.462
changing and then in this box we
can change the colour of our

53026261-9b36-4a2e-9ea2-40e63d1d2592-2
00:02:33.462 --> 00:02:33.880
symbol.

66e93f8f-f8c1-4974-8f32-e633d29cccbf-0
00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.120
Underneath these we have the
favourites.

e98b61c3-2b3b-4843-82f4-febe0ddd433a-0
00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:43.022
So this is a collection of
gallery symbols which are pre

e98b61c3-2b3b-4843-82f4-febe0ddd433a-1
00:02:43.022 --> 00:02:45.480
made symbology that we can
choose from.

e0b46da4-4081-481b-b994-109a6812a30b-0
00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.400
So let's have a look at what we
have.

e5b26e7f-a346-404b-81a6-59b415f1d770-0
00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.720
Let's go with the blue outline
symbol.

b3735643-46fd-46e7-8425-998fda71fecd-0
00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:58.767
But if you aren't happy with
this and you wanted to change it

b3735643-46fd-46e7-8425-998fda71fecd-1
00:02:58.767 --> 00:03:03.652
further then we can click in the
box here where it says simple

b3735643-46fd-46e7-8425-998fda71fecd-2
00:03:03.652 --> 00:03:04.040
line.

bc563b20-b996-438c-af61-4c03c77566ca-0
00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:09.608
We can click on where it says
simple line and this will bring

bc563b20-b996-438c-af61-4c03c77566ca-1
00:03:09.608 --> 00:03:11.960
up more options for us to
change.

a967492a-433e-4dcb-9573-664181beec01-0
00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:15.040
So we can change the colour of
the outline in here.

ef3c03e7-3feb-4621-a9f2-25d39cc51e08-0
00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:27.708
Let's change it to black and we
could also change how wide the

ef3c03e7-3feb-4621-a9f2-25d39cc51e08-1
00:03:27.708 --> 00:03:29.920
outline is.

a5c24d1c-56e1-493a-bcec-d2cca5378f19-0
00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:33.493
So if we apply what we've done
already, we can see that it's

a5c24d1c-56e1-493a-bcec-d2cca5378f19-1
00:03:33.493 --> 00:03:35.720
quite a thick outline to our
Polygon.

e2a173d0-f6b7-4879-83f9-2dcc3dc42248-0
00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.200
So let's change this to make it
a bit thinner.

105b1653-9cc1-4989-abb7-e08f8330adaa-0
00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:45.440
We'll go in stroke width and
let's put it as 0.5 instead.

f48f570b-cb84-42b3-a043-0db8dcf2be2f-0
00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:50.395
And then hit apply and we can
see that we have a thinner

f48f570b-cb84-42b3-a043-0db8dcf2be2f-1
00:03:50.395 --> 00:03:52.040
outline for our symbol.

ea3e1e58-0858-496d-bb91-19840c9f2044-0
00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:54.400
And now we can click OK.

516c5e82-c03a-4681-9a4a-8aaa413f0c86-0
00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:00.252
And so let's turn back on our
other data layers to see how it

516c5e82-c03a-4681-9a4a-8aaa413f0c86-1
00:04:00.252 --> 00:04:00.680
looks.

bc6fceb7-9d37-4c73-aa14-518a5dfe00ca-0
00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.931
And we can see that it's
blending in a bit with our land

bc6fceb7-9d37-4c73-aa14-518a5dfe00ca-1
00:04:04.931 --> 00:04:05.600
cover raster.

49855c9f-39de-42f4-ae76-ea4ae43a8769-0
00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.588
But don't worry about that
because we're going to change

49855c9f-39de-42f4-ae76-ea4ae43a8769-1
00:04:08.588 --> 00:04:11.120
how the land cover raster looks
in the next video.

75a8580a-bfee-45e9-b014-8dd2ff633f55-0
00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:14.760
And then our Polygon layer is
going to stand out more.

9cc42367-4b23-4431-917d-f970257dfbbf-0
00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:17.560
So that's how to change vector
data symbology.
